The Human Diaspora:

In the radiant dawn of the 33rd century, humanity has conquered the stars.
From the ashes of the Great Abundance Collapse; when unchecked plenty bred decay, despair, and near-extinction, the Neo-Asceticists arose. Who rejected the poison of endless comfort, embraced voluntary scarcity, and rekindled the fire of life. Guided by purpose, vitality, and faith, they claimed their birthright: the galaxy itself.
Across billions of worlds, forty quintillion souls flourish in vibrant, deliberate diversity. The Seven Tribes of Terra: Star Peoples, Cathedralites, Black Earthers, Prophet Followers, World Dreamers, Sinocrats, and Sea Peoples, form a brilliant mosaic of cultures, each pursuing its own vision of dignity, strength, and meaning. Transhumans, adapted to alien worlds, and welcomed xenos live alongside baseline humanity, all sheltered beneath the divine protection of the Imago Dei.
Above them watches the Galactic Government, the Galov, a soft theocracy of the five faiths, enforcing two iron laws: the sacred dignity of every thinking being, and the inviolable freedom of the will. Peacekeepers stand ready, to guard the boundless variety of human possibility against any who would crush it.
The stars are humanity’s inheritance. Purpose has triumphed over decadence. In disciplined scarcity, mankind has found not chains, but wings.
There is faith. There is struggle. There is endless becoming.
This is the age of the Human Diaspora. Vast, vivid, and alive.

Alternate Concise Version:

The Great Abundance Crisis was mankind's last near-extinction event.
Ninety percent were pruned;
The Children of the Lotus Eaters destroyed themselves.
Only we remain.

Much of the Collapse is unknown,
for it was Damnatio Memoriae-
scoured from record,
burned from data-vault and bone.

But from the ashes we rebuilt,
and Humanity learned a lesson we would never forget:

Purpose is paramount,
Decadence is Poison,
Mankind must reach the stars,
and claim our spiral mandate.

In the asceticism of our forebears, 
we found not chains,
but wings.

There is faith. 
There is struggle. 
There is endless becoming.
This is the age of the Human Diaspora:

Vast, vivid, and alive.

Rough Timeline of Events:
DML = Damnatio Memoriae Level, the extent which the history has been wiped out or suppressed by the Neo-Asceticists.
Pre 1990's, DML: None, nearly all of it has been well preserved.
1991 to 2008, DML: Very Low. (Preserved in Early Snapshots of the Old Internet)
2008 to 2016, DML: Low. (Notable events appear to be missing. Overall narrative still intact.)
2016 to 2025, DML: Moderate. (Major expunges. Keywords such as "Summer of Love", "ACAB", "Woke", "SJW" expunged from record. Only recorded in "Book of the Damned". Context of these terms unknown. Other terms such as "MAGA", and the "Great America Movement" are more preserved, albeit fragmented. DML drops greatly with election of President DeSantis. The Galov suspects this is part of some kind of now long forgotten culture war.)
2025 to 2040, DML: Very Low. (Ended with the election of President Victoria Cortez. Due to the DML level, the period from 1990 to 2040 is known as the Little Abundance Period. The events of the 3rd World War are very well documented.)
2040 to 2070, DML: None. (The Interwar period, as well as the 4th World War period is very well documented.)
2070 to 2170, DML: Moderate. (Beginning of the 2nd Little Abundance Period. Contradictory narratives continue to persist, with world maps and conflicting information everywhere. To the current count of the Galov, there are at least 2 major, and 4 minor conflicting narratives, each which go into different degrees of complexity. This period ends in the year 2170, with the "War for the Human Condition" beginning, a major early transhumanism war.)
2181: Meta-Man attack on Earth. DML: None.
2170 to 2300, DML: None. (Interestingly, the Neo-Asceticists did not purge the record of Earth being attacked by the Roasians, nor the occupation of Earth by the Roasians. Suggesting that their shame was not out of human pride alone, as the record of a xeno occupation of Earth is remarkably intact. Humanity liberates itself by the year 2300.)
2300 to 2350: DML: None. (Almost immediately after the defeat of the Roasians, the Transhumanism Wars kick off again, this time into the 2nd Transhumanism Wars.)
2350 to 2452, DML: Low, progressing to almost total. (Less than 100 chronological events are known from the era of 2400 to 2450. This is known as the "Great Abundance Crisis", only remembered in loose fragments, as well as the aforementioned "Book of the Damned". One of these events is the founding of the Neo-Asceticist movement, created in the year 2376.)
2452 onwards, DML: None. (No further events were deemed necessary to expunge. The Neo-Asceticists disband.)
2500's: Beginning of the Stellar Exodus.
2700's: Great Cybernetic Revolt.
2900's: Collapse of the 2nd American Republic. The last of the pre-Abundance political continuities. This marks the formal start of the age of the 7 Tribes of Terra, though others trace them as far back as the 2600's.
3000's: Conquest of the Great Khan. Near reunification of all of mankind, only stopped at the battle of Earth. The Great Assembly of the Faiths creates the modern Galov.
3100's: Consolidation of the Early Galov. Instatement of Imago Dei, and Free Will.
3300's: Second Defense of Earth. Imperial Era, crowning of the Governorship of Earth as Emperor.
3400's: Destruction of Concept Draggers, Beginning of Conceptual Era.


The Great Abundance Collapse:
"Remember always. Abundance is poison. It will lure you in with false promises. Like a drug, it will put you to sleep." -The Galov.
Galactic Society works on a basis of voluntary scarcity, not post-scarcity. Why is that? It all has to do with an event in the long distant past, and the death of humanity's last universal empire. By the 23rd and 24th centuries, much of the world was unified under the Great Universalist Empire. An entity that began in North America, and eventually took over the entire world. In what would eventually become the precursor to the Star Peoples.
By the late 24th century, consumption and traditional consumerist capitalism was entering its final stages, with what was often called the "saturation of consumption". Humanity had by and large had their needs met, their wants satiated. Nearly all production was hyper optimized. And with no more demand to fill, governments and corporations alike began to do the only thing they could think of. The inflation of demand.
The oversupply of all goods convinced the communists of the world that the day was here, refuting capitalism's claim of creative destruction, they began the "World Revolution", one which swept the world, and quickly united it around one government. But now with the drive for innovation unplugged, there was nowhere to go but to give the people what they wanted. More hedonism.
The people atrophied, men grew weaker and weaker, and the bureaucrats put in charge of "the people's factories" mismanaged them, as the standards of life around the world decayed. To satisfy the people, the world bureaucrats turned to yet even more hedonism, which decayed the minds.
It was the Neo-Asceticists, those who rejected hedonism that resisted this rot. Preserved religion, vitalism, Darwinism within their ranks. The World Revolution saw them as a threat, and they were faced with harsh persecution. But as humanity lost the will to live, and eventually procreate, the World Revolution collapsed from within. The people of the World Revolution dwindled fewer and fewer, until they all killed themselves out of despair, or died out of old age.
"Heed my words, sons of Earth. I offer you nothing... But your birthright. I offer you purpose, I offer you dignity, I offer you... The stars and the galaxy." - Oby Collins, one of the leaders of the Neo-Asceticist Movement.
The entire era, from the 24th and the 25th century was Damnatio Memoriae, of humanity's spiritual low point. The Galov does not like to talk about it. And most have aggressively expunged what their ancestors were up to during the Era of the Lotus Eaters, except those who had joined the Neo-Asceticists.
And the Neo-Asceticists would go on to settle the stars.

Voluntary Scarcity:
It should be important to note that Voluntary Scarcity is not a ceiling, it is a kind of puritanism. It does not say "we should voluntarily produce less", but "we should voluntarily limit our consumption". The Neo-Asceticists, and later thinkers in the "Spiral Mandate" would demand more for the sake of more, to mobilize and outproduce as much as they can, but to not channel this overcapacity towards consumption, but instead massive megaprojects, and star-spanning infrastructure, in what is known as "monumentalism" or "ideological capitalism", using one's wealth to either push a cause one believes in, or into grand monuments.

///
The following is a retelling of one nation among many in the Post-Abundance collapse world. The world clearly exists outside of America, but the nation serves as a good representative sample of the re-emergance of humanity after the Great Abundance collapse.

Post-Abundance Collapse America:
The now defunct United States is probably one of the most influential pre Stellar Exodus nation states, still exerting a silent influence over human space. Though some lines of institutional continuity was continued through the Abundance Collapse, some draw a distinction between the pre-collapse "First" American Republic and the post-collapse "Second" American Republic. The catastrophe of the Great Abundance Collapse acted as a "Great Filter" for the American population. So when the stars and stripes set sail for the stars again, it could be described as a "Techno-Puritan Democracy". 
Techno, for it was unapologetically, sometimes aggressively pro-technology. Puritan, for it was both religiously and ascetically fanatical, rejecting comfort for "will to power". A democracy, perhaps last time humanity attempted to apply democracy on a universal scale. Though American-style democracy still survives as the local governance of several planetary-scale regional governments. Many the result of American colonization.
The United States has long since collapsed. But it was one of the states that many future states would look back towards. Perhaps saying it was as Rome was to Europe is not quite accurate, Ancient Athens might be a more apt metaphor, given how large humanity eventually became.

The Americans that left could be categorized into many groups, as the demographics of America were fundamentally changed by the Great Abundance Collapse:
-Magnolians
--Caveliers (Magnolians but more militarized)
-Tidewater
-Breadbasket Culture
-Mayflower Culture
-Puritans
--Techno-Puritans (The de-facto elite group, stemmed from the remnants of Silicon Valley)
-Low Tech Groups
--Amish
--Mennonites
-Mormons
-Texans
--Frontiermen

The Fall of America:
The United States, in the form of the 2nd American Republic survived another 500 years after the Great Abundance Collapse. The problem was just that humanity got too large. What used to be a continental monopoly that made it the most secure nation on the block became too small to govern a humanity that was now spanning hundreds of stars. By this point, Earth was transforming into something nigh recognizable. New cultures rose and fell, and the US proper was now reduced to the area around Washington DC, roughly the states of Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia. To the south was an aggressive, expansionist empire that had grown out of the American Southwest, and the emergence of the Castillo culture. Neither American nor Mexican. 
To the north, nearly the entire Arctic circle had been taken by the Illumirians, transhuman mutants adapted to the cold, from the world of Boreas who had come to claim its throne at the roof of the world. And to the West, were a series of separatists that had parted ways with the American experiment. From the Deseret Mormons, Cascadia, the Breadbasket Peoples, and the Confederation of the Lakes. Now as distant from America as the West Europeans were to Rome.
America had long outlasted any of the peers of its time. It lived to see a world where there was no longer a Russia, nor a France, nor Mexico. Even China had gone the way of the dustbin, a completely new, yet familiar Sinitic dynasty had replaced it. The nation was small, only ceremonially the leader of a vast diaspora.
There was a time when the call to arms was sounded one final time. When the vast diaspora, spanning a thousand stars came back to Earth one last time for the defense of the mother of their culture. But when they finally arrived, they found that DC had finally fallen, and America was no more. With that, America finally passed from nation to myth.
But in the vast diaspora of the Star Peoples, Mother America had given life to many beautiful children. Many of which would surpass even her legacy across the stars.
The United States, as marginal as it was in the later years of its existence, was the last link to the pre-Abundance Collapse past. None of the nations that existed during the Great Abundance Collapse existed anymore. Earth was now a world ruled by warlords, nascent peoples and mutants. The Old Peoples of Earth had all finally left Earth. This date is considered the end of the Post-Abundance era, and the dawn of the 7 Tribes of Terra.
(Explicit note: While the Americans have one of the larger diasporas among the stars, they are only a subset of the greater Star Peoples, which are in of themselves, one of the 7 co-equal Houses of Terra.)

(Number of dashes or asterisks indicate succession.)
-This culture
--Gave succession (or is derived from/subgroup of)
--to these
--three cultures/organizations

The 7 Tribes of Terra (Sometimes called the 7 Houses of Terra):
Much of the human or posthuman diaspora can trace its origins to one of the 7 seed groups that emerged from old Earth. These groups, while normally near-baseline can have notable variation. These are known as "Terrans", and primarily live on Gaia worlds (Worlds that are similar enough to Earth and her biomes) or Gaia stations. (Huge orbital stations or O'Neil cylinders made to emulate Earth climate.)

Star Peoples (New Worlders, North America, South America and Sub-Saharan Africa)
The Star Peoples were always more of a Confederation, and as they drifted apart, they splintered into their own people groups, often peacefully just by differing ideology or geographical separation.

-Hundreds (West Africans)
--Great Constellation (Autonomous African Constellation, massive collection/constellation of diverse autonomous subgroups)
---Griot Star Council (Council of Elders)

-Dark Helmets (Prussian Militarism)
-The Eurocorps (Heroism of Service)
-The Euroacracy (Brussels-France-Germany)
--The Federation (Think Star Trek Federation)

-Great Nations (A bunch of nations meant to preserve the pre-Exodus European nations.)
-Irish-Afghanis (Just wanted to give them a special mention, not because hybrids are rare, but because this particular hybrid creates the most insane warrior race known to man.)

Black Earthers (Eurasia, Russia, Central Asia)
The Black Earthers were one civilization on paper, but more loose and autonomous in practice. So long as it did not disturb the vertical of power, lower commanders had freedom to do as they wish.

-Boreans (Another name for Russian)

--Church of Endurance
-Sky Nomads (Kazakh people, closer to the Cathedralites and the Turks. Futurist, mobile, nomadic.)

Prophet Followers (Middle East)
The Prophet Followers were more unified by a loose idea of "Dar-Al Islam" more than anything. The Holy Book and its lasting influence is the primary thing that binds them together, otherwise they act like a very loose and porous society.

-Mahdi Followers (Revelations of the Mahdi)
--School of Mysticism
--School of Rationalism
--School of Fanaticism (Sometimes called "the True School", though only internally)

-Mahalla Culture (Desert Oasises, South Central Asian)
-New Ottomans (The Turks who sided with the Prophet Followers over the Cathedralites)

World Dreamers (Indian/Dharmic)
The World Dreamers classically see themselves as one meta-civilization. But on closer inspection, they are instead lots and lots of different groups existing in symboisis, or parasitism, depending on who you ask.

-Brahmins (Knowledge Workers)
--Computer/Information Caste (Coders and Programmers)
---The Overmen (Humans as ubermensch, who maintain control over the machines. Transhumanist)

---Overclockers (Psychic-based transhumanist ascension)
--Dharmics (More traditional religiosity)
-Kshatriyas (Warriors and Organizers)
--Akhand Bharat (The great Indian Empire)
-Vaisyas (Skilled Workers)
--World Merchants (Interact a lot with all the other merchant factions in other societies.)
-Sudra (Common People)
-Dalits (Outside the system)
--Caste Breakers 
--Dalit Revolutionary Army (Reversing genetic changes, radical human egalitarianism)
---Hive Dalit (The most radical of these. Total genetic equality, all humans a clone of the greater hive.)
--Exodites (Those who leave the system to live in deep space)
-Crescent Men (Outside the Dharmic caste system, closer to the Prophet Followers)
-Karmanics (Outside the Dharmic caste system, closer to the Sea Peoples and the Faith of the Wheel.)

Sinocrats (Sino/Confucian)
The Sinocratic core is consisting of two things. Meritocratic Legalism and Bureaucracy. Only somewhat balanced by the addition of Confucian values. Those who break away exist, and are directed towards Buddhist or Taoist philosophy. The Sinocratic Core is almost unified by default, with periphery cultures (Mainly Korea) occasionally breaking away. The Celestial Kingdom continuously falls and is revived, being the longest continuity of heritage dating all the way back to ancient times.
The Platinum Emperor (AI) is more of a ceremonial figure. The secular god of the kingdom, his dictats are absolute. He is fragmented and tired. Only on occasion does the current Celestial Emperor (human) consult him for advice, to which it will respond cryptically.

-Celestial Kingdom
--Han Nationalist Celestial Army
--Dragon Kingdoms (Servents of genetically engineered "Celestial Dragons". Tolerated transhuman nobility, basically.)
--Confucian Monastary Worlds (Independent school worlds that stayed out of politics)
--Houses of Wisdom (Apolitical and independent meritocratic school systems)
--Koreans
---Sinocratic Aligned-Vassal Worlds
---Great Daega (New cult movement, made to solve the issues of modern materialism)
---Holy Church of Light (Friendly with the Star People)
--Democratic Army
--Southeast Asians
---The Royal Houses (Alternated between the Sinocrats to the Sea Peoples)
-The Great Khan (The most ambitious individual humanity ever produced, gathered a ragtag team of everyone he could get, and tried to aim for galactic dominance. Got the closest to ever reunifying humanity.)
--Lesser Khans (Made up by his sons. All of them are competing to reunify the humanity and reclaim the title of Great Khan.)
-Steel Men (More a hired mercenary people, who was in an alliance with the Celestial Kingdom. Maintained the Emperor AI.)
--The Steel Sons (The literal children of the Emperor)
--The Blended Ones (Machine-Flesh Hybrids)
-Petty Emperors (Other dynasties outside the central Celestial Kingdom)
--Chu Dynasty (Manchus)
--Ruiguo (Confucian oriented)
--Buddhalands
--Daoguo (Taoist oriented)
--Tyrant Emperors (Pejorative towards Legalist States)

Sea Peoples (Southeast Asian)
Along the with Star Peoples, are classically seen as the "newest" of the old civilizations. Consolidation as a civilization wasn't complete until the mid to late 21st century. This is less of a political polity, and more of a loose cultural and people group. Similar to the Star People, they're more of a loose confederation, and splinter easily with geographic distance.

-Pancasila Culture (Pluralistic multicultural Southeast Asian)
-Junglers (Land-based SEA)
--Allah Followers (Localized Islam)
--Temple Builders (Prioritize the sacred as separation from outside world.)
--Flow-Way (Nature has a flow, just go with it. Pseudo-Taoist)
-Maritime Culture (Sea/Space-based)

-Great Trade Houses (Chinese merchants in the space age)
--Casino Lords (They make a lot of money and they are in high demand)
-Dreamweavers (Those who spin psychically imbued fabric.)

Minor peoples:

Holy Israel (The last remaining independent nation on Earth.)
-Wandering Jew Fleet (Nomadic Jews)
-Kosbollah (Astro-Mystics, Recording the many names of God they encounter across the stars.)

Church of Latter Day Saints (Great Temple Collapse)
-Reform Mormonism (Progressive Revelation Ongoing, Law Unbinding)
-Conservative Mormonism (Progressive Revelation Ongoing, Law Binding)
-Orthodox Mormonism (Progressive Revelation Ceased, Law Binding)

Sublime Dominion (Iranian/Persian) (Rather isolationist, it's easier to keep up your image of detached perfection if you have no enemies.)
-His Sublimeness (An immortal, genetically perfect king of kings. Doesn't have much power but keeps up the image of perfection. "Above" politics.)
-Prime Minister (Actually runs the government day to day. His Sublimeness doesn't get involved, but can sack him if he is displeased.)
--Dominion Revolutionary Army (A group of democratic and religious revolutionaries.)

Sun Peoples (Japan):
-Sun Kingdoms (Split into a bunch of warring houses that fight for the claim of central Shogun)
-The Neon Houses (Corporate/Chaebol controlled worlds.)

Lost Tribes:
The Lost Tribes are a kind of "lost 8th tribe" of sorts. Not lost because they're actually lost, but because they are normally grouped in with others, and some advocate for them to become the 8th tribe. Though due to everything from the flag, to the mythos, and everything else referencing the number 7, and general "good vibes" of the number 7, there is much inertia in the way.
The Lost Tribes are normally categorized as parts of the Star Peoples, and while some people of indigenous heritage are fine with being part of the "New Worlders", alongside Sub-Saharan Africans, North and South Americans, others ask for a categorical distinctiveness.
Compared to the other subgroups of the 7 Tribes, these groups are fairly small, and somewhat underrepresented in the Human Diaspora, due to their lack of population base during the time of the Stellar Exodus.
The Lost Tribes are divided into two groups. The Primitivists and the Modernists. The Primitivists seek to preserve live before some pre-defined time, normally the age of colonialism. Modernists seek to advance their culture forward into the future. Unless otherwise noted, all groups have both primitivist and modernist variants.
-Caretakers
--(North)
---Sky-Watchers (Great Plains)
---Wind-Walkers (They really like flying and aviation, apparently.)
---Mound Builders (Mississippi)
---Redwood Culture (West Coast)
---Ice-Walkers (Inuit)
--(South)
---Riverroot Culture (Amazon)
---Canopy Culture
---Mountain Shapers (Inca, they really like the Mountains)
--Dream Watchers (Aboriginal Australians)
-Gift Givers (They use voluntary scarcity economics to create the gift economy)
-The Architects (A more modernist take on Indigenous culture, based more on Ecological preservation.)
--Solarians (Extreme environmentalism mixed with extreme techno-optimism.)
---Xenolects (Preserve xeno ecology)
---Terralects (Spread and preserve Old Earth's ecology.)
-Hearth-Fire Cultures (Indigenous African, Primitivists only. Modern African diaspora are seen as "Star People", and to the Hearth-Fires, are "Black Europeans".)
--Iron Tongues (Oralists, have banned writing.)
---Tongue-Speakers (Iron Tongues who have reintegrated with modern society, but kept the prohibition on writing or memory devices.)
--Old Griots (Abstrains from the Great Confederation.)

The Gift Givers, the Architects, and the Solarians:
These three are the "Big Three" of the Modernist side of the Lost Tribes. While the Primitivists are contetn with returning to the glory days of the past, the modernists are not content with simply returning to the past, they seek to actively build the future that is unapologetically theirs. Not just a crude imitation of the futures already forged by the white, black, or yellow man.

The Other Worlds:
Though the "7 Houses" are a useful way to categorize the 7 seed groups of humanity. They are far from all inclusive, even if we're solely talking about baseline humans, not even touching things like transhumans yet. The state of the galaxy is so pluralistic, fragmented, and so many permutations of hybrids exist that the following exercise can be attempted.
Imagine for a moment, any reasonable permutation of human culture, so long as it is physically possible, and stable enough to not collapse within a generation. That likely exists somewhere in the vast expanses of the "Other Worlds". Every permutation can you imagine of people coming together and creating hybrid cultures, likely exists. There are variants of Swedish-Thai, Turkmenistani-Botswanan, an Taiwanese-Tibetan-Paraguayan-Dinkan amalgamation culture, so on, and so forth.
And there is not even a limitation of primarily drawing on real cultures. Entire worlds have been founded on fandom, or fantasy concepts, creating new cultures from fiat, ideology, or new stories. The "Big 5" of religions dominate, but new religions have been founded based on ideology, or secularism, or humanism, to a misinterpreted fandom interpreting fiction as real, or a comedic misinterpretation of "Lord of the Rings". A splinter emerges from a splinter from a splinter until it no longer resembles the original. It is said nearly every permutation of the human condition can be found in the Other Worlds.
For reference, it is estimated only about 40% of the baseline human population is "cleanly" part of the 7 tribes. The rest is a ever evolving fractal of human creativity and new ways of living. The main "organized megaculture" or "organized structure" outside of the 7 tribes is the Yanko-Ring, and many of these "Other Worlds" are located in what are sometimes called "the Brilliant Worlds". Or the "Middle Ring" between the core territories of the 7 Tribes, and the Yanko Ring.
The primary limitation is that they not violate the Galov's mandate of Imago Dei, nor the mandate on free will. More on that later.

Notable examples:
-The Contract States (No direct lineage from the 7 Tribes, instead a libertarian voluntary contract state.)
--Treaty Keepers (A specifically indigenous focused crypto contract state. Good luck breaking the treaty when they're enforced by code.)
-Union of Workers Darwinist Republics (Darwinistic Cyber-Communism. Seen with suspicion by the Galov, but decided they were acceptable after they found out they promoted weight lifting and collective action as opposed to hedonism.)
-The Other Houses (Lots of crackpot monarchies carved out by a military warlord, who later created an aristocratic form of governance, and accepted an honor code, softening greatly as a result.)
-The Technocratic Unions (Core group splintered from the Prophet Followers, originating from Mesopotamia-descended peoples.)
-Cities of Light (Tourist trap, the planet. There's one in every sector. They bloom and die like mushrooms, sustained entirely by hype. In 100 years, they will be gone, and more will have taken their place.)
-Fable Makers (Apparently a bunch of artistic types intentionally celebrate fandom culture, and indulge in creative/expressive excess.)

Union of Workers Darwinist Republics:
"Luxuries are a bourgeois decadence. The purpose of a worker is to work, to rise above, and become strong enough to demand their own liberation. The capitalist class wants a weak and docile working class. We call for them to train, to rise as the director of their own destiny, to tear down the system of capital with their will and strength alone. Workers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains!"
An absolutely bizarre ideological movement, this is the one form of communism that the Galov has been able to tolerate. In contrast to most communist movements, which devolve into hedonism, decadence, and societal collapse from the overindulgence in automated luxuries, the UWDR views them with utter contempt. They believe in empowerment of the self, the cultivation of strength, and the belief that work is a virtue, one which makes you stronger. And urges all workers to toil for the sake of the revolution, that all workers may find empowerment through their own strength.
The entire population is a population of "shock workers", and have achieved almost superhuman abilities through sheer training. They believe decadence to be capitalist poison, as luxury and wealth. They believe the capitalist class becomes obsolete when the workers empower themselves through training, and see most "Western progressive" communists to be capitalist subversions. The Galov is utterly befuddled by this movement, but as they do not advocate for hedonism, their one cardinal rule, they have mostly been left alone.
The UWDR has dominated weightlifting competitions for decades now, and weightlifting is one of the nation's most popular pastimes. Ironically, or perhaps uniquely for any communist movement, this has created a hyper-meritocratic form of communism. Where private property is abolished, all people start at an even footing (all start with nothing but their own bodies and minds), but your destiny is your responsibility and yours alone. They straight up desire to completely render the capitalist class obsolete by making the workers so strong they can do all the work of the capitalists, ending class exploitation.
The weak and the disabled are given augmentations, but they are still expected to overcome with willpower. It is okay to be born weak, it is not okay to stay weak. All are expected to improve, to dominate, not necessarily to compete with others, but to compete with your self.

Half-Xeno Worlds:
These are human-dominated worlds with a large xeno minority, or even plurality/majority. If even the Other Worlds don't fit your desire for pluralism, this is here to spell it out explicitly. You can also craft hybrid worlds (or pure xeno worlds) based on any alien found here, or heck, one you make up yourself.

The Pact of the Sons of Man/the House of Man:
Though these groups generally bicker a ton, there is a collective agreement that if human civilization, or the Earth itself comes under threat, then every group will put aside their differences and come together in common defense of the species. This agreement was invoked exactly twice. Once during the conquests of the Great Khan, when his armies finally came to the doorstep of Earth, and once again when a galaxy eater came within 3 light years of Earth, and almost 20% of the galactic population pitched in to participate in the Leviathan battle to come. Terra is sacred, Terra is holy.

Transhuman Groups:

"Transhuman" here is not used to prefer to humans who modified their genes (Almost all groups do that). Instead, it's an almost pejorative term to refer to those who are biologically human-descended groups which trace their lineage to something other than an old Terran culture. (Though this includes the minor peoples such as the Sublimians or the Jews.) Instead, Transhuman groups trace their lineage to the first settlers lab grown and engineered to settle difficult to settle worlds. Most transhuman groups are specialized for a single world, and then continuously transplanted to new compatible worlds. Most transhumans are planet bound, unable to take advantage of economies of scale due to their heavily genetically splintered nature.
Due to their utility as a tool, as opposed to being people, they are seen as tools or "less-than" normal Terran groups. The Transhumanist League is a major transhumanist rights advocacy group that promotes transhuman interests. Just like the Terran groups, they descend from several seed groups, usually from life-compatible, but not human inhabitable worlds near Earth, and splintered outwards as well.
Outside of these main groups, basically every "near-habitable" world has its own transhumanist culture that is usually exclusive to just that one world.

Lunarians (Creator: Star Peoples)

Luna was settled by near-baseline Star Peoples, and specially engineered Lunarians, made for low gravity worlds. Their culture is said to be quiet, cold, and sterile, much like their environment. Though they were outside of the "mainline" 7 tribes, their close proximity and eventual massive political influence bought them a seat at the table. They're the strongest culture outside of the 7 tribes.
As well, Luna received a lot of influence from the early Omnithecia, adopting a large East African influence, and importing the Omnithecian library, which eventually became the Lunar Library.
-Luna (Discovered to have moderate amounts of water in Lunar regolith)
--Regolith Culture (For drier worlds)
---Mercurians (For even hotter, drier worlds.)
---Dust Culture (For colder, drier worlds.)
--Lunar Lavatube Culture (Colloquially called "Lunar Molemen")
---Blackwater Culture (For wetter, airless worlds. They live in cold underwater aquafirs.)
--Star Dwarves (For when they were sent to even lower gravity dwarf planets.)
---Specklers (When they were basically sent to inhabit asteroids.)
----Void Dwellers (Low energy, resource efficient which move slow motion near in the stellar depths. Isolationist, barely moves, very fast time perception.)
--Gemstone Culture (See Diamond Belt below)
-Omnithecians (Loosely/incorrectly translatable as "the All-Library")
--Librarians
--The Lunar Library

Dust Eaters/Original Martians (Creator: Star Peoples)

Dust Eaters was the original group sent to colonize Mars, barely seen as human at the time, mostly there just to filter the air before the real human settlers came in. Displaced from their holy homeland of Mars, and sent across the stars to colonize other "dust worlds". They claim to be the original Martians.
-Mars
--Dust Raiders (Syncretism/Alignment with Sand Raider Culture)
--Dry Oasis Culture (These people brought around their own water retaining plants to create local dry oasis)
--Dust Sailors (Those who ride duststorms)
--New Red Army (Martian Nationalists who want to retake Mars)
---Sons of Mars (Extremist terrorist organization, a la ISIS.)
--Noachians (Found a niche operating "half-terraformed" worlds where water has been ported, but no soil yet.
--Martian Lavatube Culture (Same as Luna's, but on Mars, with different customs)

Illumirians (Creator: Black Earthers)

Illumirians were first created to settle the cold, icy world of Illumir, with temperatures akin to Antarctica. Since then, they've become the go-to species to colonize anything too cold for baseline humans.

-Illumirians
--Lantern Cultures (Veneration of light)
--Empire of Light (Illumirians became powerful enough to eventually form their own empire, and even bring the Terrans to notice them.)
---Starlight Culture (Empire of Light Remnants that eventually found and allied with the Void Dwellers and some Speckler peoples. Wants to bring back the Old Empire of Light Culture.)
--Twilightism (The most popular religion among the Illumirians)
--Anglerfish Culture (Illumirians who settled cold/frozen oceans.)
--Ice Settlers (Similar to specklers, but with more ice.)
---Shard Children (Similar to the Void Dwellers.)
---Dead Moon Society (Those who settle REALLY distant Oort cloud-equivalent planets. There are dozens in the Solar System alone.)
--Penrosers (Those who settled around black holes.)

Europans (Creator: Cathedralites)

Europans are aquatic transhumans sent to settle the icy moon of Europa. They now specialize for both deep oceans and sub-glacial oceans.

-Europans
--Seaweed Culture (Grew to be cooperative with the Tonope xenosophonts. Are humanity's go to to interpret Tonopean thoughts, though most of their expressions cannot be translated into human language.)
--Deepfire Culture (Users of deepfire, an exotic kind of combustion that functions at extremely high underwater pressures.)
---Abyssal Societies (Eventually they went so deep into the cores of their ocean worlds they lost contact with humanity.)
--The Great Schools (Supercolony/fish-school like instinctive phermonal markers that have created transplanetary empires with little/no communication. Divided into many.)
--Aquatic Diaspora (Europans sometimes live above surface in specialized body suits in non-Europan communities)
---Sea Merchants (Starfaring Europans who largely sell goods to other Europan worlds or sometimes other humans.)

Icarusians (Creators: Cathedralites)

Humans modified with wings, made to navigate atmospheres with oppressing, dense atmospheres. Have the ability to sleep in the air. Are close enough to human mythological angels that they're liked, though they hold little real power. Liked, because they're not a threat.

-Icarusians
--Avians (Bird-like)
---Heaven's Palace (Jovian space station, Icarusian cultural nexus. All near-human)
---Heaven's Periphery (Lots of smaller bubble-domes around Jupiter.)
----Celestials (Those who stayed more true to their human appearance)
----Neo-Avians (Those who leaned more into their bird-like appearance)
----The Diaspora ("Oh wow! A real angel! Can I take a photo?")
--Vampirian (Bat-like)
---The Cabal (Meritocratic organization trying to hijack high ranking governments.)
---The Undersociety (Broader Vampirian society, secretive.)
--Faerian (Insectoid Wings)
---Butterfly Culture (Expressive artistic.)
---Fairydust Culture (Faerian, but way more into psychedelics, experience, hedonism, and drugs.)

Tokians (Creators: Prophet Followers)

Tokians were created to deal with the high CO2 heavy atmospheres of the world of Tolkien. Made to be very strong and durable. Do a lot of dirty and frankly dangerous work, as they are seen as inherently polluted, and dirty. Typically seen as brutes, but are, like every human group, more complicated under the surface.

-Tokians (Humanoids with thick, scaly skin. Looks a bit like the Thing.)
--Smog Eaters (Subgroup specifically made to work in hellish factory worlds.)
---Smog Singers (A group trying to prove Tokians were more than just brutes. Intentionally live an ascetic life to produce beautiful music and art. Quite detached from normal life, so their songs end up being inwardly focused, out of touch, yet weirdly compelling.)
---Calligraphers (Tokian branch) (The Calligraphers have most of their transhuman members come from the Tokian group.)
--Gravity Hogs (AKA Hogs, made to do heavy labor in high gravity conditions. Ancestors to the later Gravity Men and Beasts.)
---Gravity Men (Made for heavy worlds, they eventually reverted to breathing oxygen, so we call them man.)
---Gravity Beasts (Almost exactly the same as gravity men, but because they still breath C02, we call them beasts.)
----Gravity Compact (The gravity people themselves had no time for human BS, they formed a partnership nation with equal representation between both.)
--Black Hole Culture (Those who settled very close in to black holes and neutron stars, surviving their dense gravitational pull when no one else could. Conflict with the Penrosers.)

The Other Transhumans:
The above 6 groups are known as the "Core 6", the largest and most numerous transhuman groups, created during the early days of the Stellar Exodus, and therefore became most widespread throughout the passage of time. However, they are not the only transhuman groups, as others have been created. As going through them all, just like with nations, or subcultures would take ages, instead they can be grouped into broad categories.

Temperants: Made to adopt to certain temperatures.
Void Humans: Made to adapt to the vacuum of space. This is a whole category in of itself, with countless adaptations. Void Dwellers of the Illumirians are sometimes included in this group.

Gravitants: Made for heavy gravity.

Grafthumans: A catchall to refer to when the Galov, or some other organization finds a planet with pre-existing life, and engineers a race of humans to "graft" onto the native ecosystem. These Transhumans are almost single-planet by design, though as humans do, they will try to spread and adapt where possible. These grafthumans tend to be anything from "90% human translated into another ecosystem's equivalent of DNA, because other ecosystems don't necessarily use DNA", or "50% human, 50% whatever we could find", or "pretty much 0% genetically human, except the brain and psychology, which is modelled after humans".

Atmospherants: A catchall to refer to when humans had them breathe different atmospheres.
-Methane-Breathers: Exactly what it sounds like.
-Hydrogen-Breathers: Also exactly what it sounds like.

Sun Suckers: (The 7th unofficial major Transhuman Group, they're separated from the Core 6 since they're not planetary-based. An arbitrary a distinction as can be, but since when has that stopped humanity?)
An absolutely crazy idea when people engineered people to both live in the void, have high heat tolerance, resilience to radiation, and obtain energy from photosynthesis. They like to create "sun-rafts" floating around stars. Sun-raft civilizations are known to clash with energy utility boards when someone finally decides to set up a Dyson Swarm around a star. There are different variants who each enjoy a different kind of star. There is an even crazier group who likes living around pulsars or gravitars. Humanity tends to leave these ones alone because they're crazy bastards even by THEIR standards.
They tend to be entirely separate from the dominant Galov mainstream society, both the 7 Great Tribes of Terra, and the 6 Transhuman Groups. They like forming their own sun-raft societies around stars, and they tend to run into conflict should Galov-aligned society wish to use a star as well. The most successful of these by far are the red dwarf sun suckers, who have an effectively infinite amount of stars to choose from, and a galaxy too apathetic to care about the 10 billion-th red dwarf star.
Sun Suckers tend to absorb light through photosynthesis cells on their stomach. If they ever integrate back into "mainstream" human society, the Galov sells hard light diets where you just add heat to release the light back into its photonic form. Comes in different colors and radiation types as well. Sun Suckers report it "tastes" (They don't really taste, but close enough) artificial and a bit flat, but it's fine enough.

The Diamondgrass Revolt

As was probably expected by this point, this level of suppression was not without resentment. A while (as in a few hundred years) after the conquests of the Great Khan was finally defeated at the Battle of Earth by a coalition of all of the 7 Houses of Terra, the transhuman groups rallied around a leader called Diamondgrass, a Lunarian princess and de-facto regent of a powerful world, and powerful psychic that successfully bridged the vast communication gaps between each of the transhuman species. And rallied them to force the galaxy to take them seriously, and demanding galaxy-wide equality before the law. Her campaign began falling apart as the heir came of age, and bickered with her over the direction of the war, leading to its eventual defeat. Though it was not all for naught, as the area around her kingdom effectively seceded from the rest of humanity, forming the Diamond Belt.

Diamond Belt

The Diamond Belt is a transhuman-majority region meant to act as one cohesive political bloc to advocate for transhuman equality, as well as serve as a "homeland" for diverse transhumans. Heavy terraforming and geo-engineering was required to fit all the new immigrants, resulting in a population density higher than anywhere but the Solar Region. It currently controls about 2% of the inhabitable volume of humanity. The Diamond Belt is still extremely reliant on the Diamondgrass Family for its cohesion, as the succession passes into its 4th, and now 5th generation, as they are the only group of psychics powerful enough to unify the transhumans. Some fear about the latest heir's relative lack of psychic ability has fueled fears of fragmentation.

The Diamond War

The fragile peace kept by the Diamondgrass family has splintered, with the tragic infertility of the Diamondgrass family being their ultimate downfall. Despite being pregnant 12 different times, the last member of the Diamondgrass family was unable to have a heir in time before their untimely death. Almost immediately, the realm became engulfed in a succession war over the strong and powerful empire, one of the strongest in the entire galaxy. (Humanity was splintered to such a degree that 2% of human space is enough to make you at least a top 5 great power) When one of them finally came out on top, they needed a way to unify the disparate peoples of the Diamond Belt, and the way they did it, much like in real history is to rally them against an outside people, being the 7 Tribes of Terra. This war lasted a while, but ended up in a massive tribal confederation pushing them back to Diamond space, but not wanting to risk having such a massive rebellious population on their hands, the tribes ended up putting one of the other contenders to the throne in charge, and left them alone.

The Gemstone Culture:

Though the Diamond Belt started out as a major alliance of transhuman groups at first, over time they created their own kind of status hierarchy. The colors of the gemstones were borrowed from the Terran's own classification of each transhuman group with a color. Lunarians were white, Martians were orange, Illumirians were black, Europans were blue, Icarusians were red, and the Tokians were yellow. The transhuman groups in the Diamond Belt eventually evolved into the Gemstone Culture, as the color distinctions used by Terrans was eventually adopted by the Diamond Belt itself, and the tiered society increasingly resembled a caste system. These gemstones ended up becoming a new group of people around the Diamond Belt, while still in touch with their transhuman brothers, were increasingly distinct.
As these identities hardened, entrenched interests/guilds/unions in all castes began pushing for the excluding of outsiders from their profession, wanting to avoid competition, entrenching these divisions further, a few generations after the Diamondgrass Rebellion. The stifling of innovation and calcification of these identities is probably why the Diamond Belt eventually lost its technological edge over the rest of the galaxy, though not entirely.

-Diamonds (Lunarians, Rulers and Psychics)
-Obsidians (Illumirians, Bureaucrats)
-Ambers (Martians, Soldiers and Warriors)
-Rubies (Icarusians, Priests)
-Sapphires (Europans, Merchants)
-Opals ("Other Transhumans", Somewhat outside the system)
-Citrines (Tokians, Manual Laborers)

Of most note, the Sun Suckers have largely opted out of the Diamond Belt, and are happy with their sun raft civilizations far away from Galov civilization.

Coming of Age Ceremonies:
While for many worlds and cultures, they live largely stationary, stable lives. In many others, especially in the more cosmopolitan or individualist ones, it is customary for young adults, normally around 15 to about 25 to engage in a period of exploration or adventuring as a coming of age ceremony. In Galovian documentation, it is officially termed "the Great Transition", or the liminal space between adolescence and adulthood. Though in various cultures, it is known as "Rumspringa", "Walkabout", "Vision Quest", and many, many other names.
The exact names and rituals differ by culture, but in general it works like this. A young youth leaves their local home, and goes out to the stars for some kind of quest in order to complete their transition from youth to adult. The purpose of these differ. For some, it is to trace the paths of their ancestors. For others, it is a way to allow a choice between their home culture, and the outside world. For some, it's just networking or information gathering, a hero's journey in order to gather the knowledge of the galaxy, and to bring it back to one's familiar home. Nearly all serve as a "test" of one's self sufficiency and honing of their abilities.
Some examples of rituals:
-"Slumming it out" on a limited budget. Sometimes fasting, in order to grow empathy for the poor. (Common in World Dreamer traditions.)
-To visit a world of all 7 Tribes, in order to open one's mind to possibilities.
-A pilgrimage to Earth, or at least one of the older worlds as a way to reconnect with the roots of humanity.
-Living among the ways of another culture. You can take this even further by living with a xenosophont, which will give you even more prestige back at home.
-Living with a religious institution as a part of growing up, to give back to the divine, and to connect with a higher power. Some end up becoming priests, nuns, or monks as a result. The religious institutions themselves support this.
-To go on some kind of dangerous adventure. To go exploring in an unknown space. This can either be planetary (exploring an uninhabited planet) or interplanetary (exploring empty space in a ship). In a sense, this is "space colonization training".
-To hone survival skills.
-To be deployed on a foreign mission as part of a regional militia. If you can become a Galactic Peacekeeper, that's seen with even more prestige on militaristic worlds, though the Peacekeepers aren't interested in taking anyone.
-To study at a prestigious institution.
-To develop a new skill, usually creative or innovative.
-Starting a business in a different environment, to teach self sufficiency and bootstraps.
Mix and match any of the above. Plenty of sedentary cultures do also have coming of age rituals, but they are more planet-bound, though they almost always usually feature the same ideas.

The Martian Jihad

One of the most destructive wars in human history, by the time of the great Martian Jihad, Mars was already a major hub for many cultures. Specifically the New American Republic, a major power of the Solar System covering about half the Martian surface, along with various Magnolian, Roman, and PMC influences. These were frequently named "New Americans", and will be referred to as such. Mars was very well politically connected, having the ear of half the mercenary groups in the entire galaxy.

The Dust Eaters did not care. They had gathered a jihad of magnitude not seen since the days of the Great Khan. They didn't have an army as large as that, but they didn't need to. They weren't here to wage war on humanity.

They were here to take back their home.

As a populated world, there was a degree of common courtesy, a kind of "international law of war" that forbade planetary bombardment, especially as Mars was ancient. To both the New Americans and the Old Martians, Mars was sacred. Neither of them would lay a finger on it if it could be helped. They wanted Mars intact. Unfortunately, it is hard to keep something undamaged in times of war.

Massive fleets began appearing in Mars orbit, as news rang out that the Solar System had become a site for battle. The Martians had rallied half their entire diaspora for this war. One great attack to take back their home, take back their holy land. The New Americans did not come unprepared, mercenaries were on their way, from every corner of the galaxy. Mars was an important hub for business, and was not a small world in terms of how many forces it could marshal. The New Americans had military experience, but the Martians had almost religious fanaticism, zeal, and numbers. The Martians had to fight a military. The New Americans had to fight an entire people group.

The New Americans tried to invoke the Pact of the Sons of Man, arguing it covered the entire Solar System, not just Earth, but everyone else was far more hesitant. This wasn't an existential matter. Mars was not Earth, the Martians were not here to destroy humanity. As such, most of humanity just watched from the sidelines, even the rest of the House of Star People largely remained muted on the plight of the New Americans, with the Mayflower culture's ambassador issuing "an official condolences".

A collossal pile of ships began piling up around Mars, the New American spacefleet blockaded Low Martian Orbit from below with the Martian Surface, and from above by its spacefleet. The Great Martian Siege had begun. There was now a huge spacefleet consisting of a massive Martian population trapped in orbit, running out of supplies, while the New American navy seemed content to starve them out. So close to their homeland, yet so far. Whenever a Martian starved to death in low Mars orbit, they would deorbit themselves and orbitally bombard the Martian surface with their space vessel, so at least in death their body could return to their holy land.

This sparked outrage all over the galaxy. News reached the Diamond Belt, where transhuman populations began to protest and decry what they called a mass starvation campaign. Images immediately went out of people in hollow containers running out of food, still staring longingly at the world below. It was declared a humanitarian catastrophe. On the other side, some of the deorbiting vessels were intentionally filled with explosives. One of these landed in Providence City, the capital of Mars, instantly killing 300 people. Causing the New Americans to radicalize and demand the galaxy bring them to justice, invoking the Pact of the Sons of Man. Several times the New American Navy ordered the besieged Martians to leave, several times they declined.

This is perhaps why the Martian struggle ended up winning the PR battle. The 7 Houses were largely neutral. The Diamond Belt was not.

The tactic used to end the war was a brutal one. With public opinion around the galaxy souring, and more and more pressure piling in from the outside, and the entire galaxy polarizing on this issue. The New Americans intentionally caused mass Kessler Syndrome to begin occurring around Low Martian Orbit, causing an extreme chain reaction that began destroying the Martian ships. After many, many months in a siege, these ships were low on fuel, and sometimes unable to evade the Kessler debris, even if they were trying to. This is without a doubt the most controversial moment of the entire war. But without a doubt, it worked, with the remnants of the Martian Jihad scattering.

It is estimated that 5-10% of the entire Martian Diaspora died during the siege. In the aftermath, the Kessler debris was eventually cleaned up, and Mars was reopened for business, but transhuman boycotts of Martian/New American businesses continue to this day.

Of note is the fact that the Ambers of the Diamond Belt were certainly the loudest among decrying the atrocity being perpetuated on their brotherly Martians, but suspiciously few went to fight for them, and they were already used to treating Martians as slightly "less-than". More likely than not, the Ambers only cared so much as it boosted their social standing.

Star Types and Civilization:

O and B Stars: These are used for two things. One is massive energy harvesting initiatives, the entire star is harvested for its light to produce hard light batteries. The second are "Maximalist Systems". Every time some hyper ambitious governor wants to create "the greatest system the world has ever seen", just pack it with as many orbital stations as a star can handle, and consume as much energy as it can handle, blue stars always had a seductive appeal. They would come in with possibly an entire galaxy sector's worth of settlers, purchase the star from the local energy utility board, and make a Matrioshka brain look quaint.

A and F types: These are known as "Bright Worlds". No habitable worlds are expected here. But they are targets for massive terraforming initiatives. If you want a custom planet sculpted here, or you want to build Eden, then you look here. Extra sunlight is always a nice plus, and so is extra energy. You just need the startup costs, so this kind of attracts the upper middle class of the galaxy. F types are preferred to A types, because everyone likes the yellow suns on a psychological level.

G and K types: "Gaia Worlds". These places actually have Earth like worlds, and on occasion the rare xenobiotic life world. Xenobiological zones are turned into stellar observatories, harvesting zones for orthogonal ideas. They're also the easiest to settle, (Especially if plants have already broken up the soil nice and well) and contain the bulk of the human population. And besides, everyone just psychologically prefers a yellow sun. Orange worlds are more likely to have xenobiological life, and contain more xenos, making them stigma'd somewhat as being a place for the lower class.

M types: There are so many of these that they're cheaper than dirt in cosmic terms. The Galactic Government just likes to hide all their secret projects on red dwarves. Because any orange dwarf or higher will attract attention, but barely anyone cares about red dwarves. Some are settled, but no one really likes living around one. There's practically no population density, no infrastructure, and humans just tend to skip over them during colonization. The main people who settle here do so for ideological reasons. The "Spiral Worlds", who believe humanity will ascend, think ultra long term, and want to get ready for the Heat Death of the Universe. Also people who want to get cryogenically frozen for TRILLIONS of years.

Autotranslators:
Invented in 22nd or 23rd century India, using psychic intent to translate one's words into another language, it was first created to accomodate India's vast multicultural society and variety of languages, but it eventually went global. Today, autotranslators are about as common as the spoon, and about as unremarkable.

Language:
The autotranslator created a revolution in language. English was the last time there was a lingua franca. The invention of the autotranslator removed most of the incentive to learn how to speak other languages other than the one you were familiar with. Many people still learned English, if only to make sure their business contracts were up to scratch, and as a sense of being "cultured", long after it lost its practical purpose. But in the centuries since the Great Abundance Collapse, the languages of old have been massively splintered.
Only a few universal languages remain. First is Celestial, or Mandarin, still the standardized language of the Celestial Kingdom, who restricted autotranslators to maintain their monolingual culture, much to the chagrin of many linguistic minorities living under the Celestial Kingdom. But the usage of this language is heavily regionalized.
Aside from that, the only universal languages are largely liturgical languages. Old Arabic, needed to read the original Quran remains in use in order to translate from the Quran, and has diverged from the countless dialects of "Neo-Arabic", whose branches have now reached into the thousands, and become increasingly less intelligable by the decade. Latin has emerged as the "cultured language" of the Christian sects, with the Roman Catholic Church now making official rulings on the Latin language. Greek, Sanskrit, and Hebrew have also been preserved for similar reasons.
From English, it has split into at least three branches, which in of themselves are vast language trees. Yanko, the language family of the Yankee-American descended branch, Magnolian, a more Southern branch which fused with AAVE, Anglo-Gothic, what the English and their descendents ended up speaking, and Anglish, a rough bridge tongue between Yanko and Anglo-Gothic. Each one of these trees have dialects, some of which are not mutually intelligable. The difference between Yanko and Anglo-Gothic at this point is comparable to the difference between English and Dutch. You will get some words, feel some familiarity, but be lost in actual meaning.
This is before we even consider the fact that the autotranslator has liberated language from strict meaning, and language has increasingly become something for the sake of artistic and personal expression, as the autotranslator only cares about your intent, not actual wording. Language has become increasingly musical in nature, created for audial beauty, not actual intelligibility, letting the autotranslator's intent filter do the heavy lifting. Languages where you don't speak words at all, and instead just try to sing as beautifully as possible, are known as "singer languages". There has been a language that one "speaks" solely by saying the word "tan" over and over again, and then letting the intent filter do the rest. The autotranslator can even translate sign language, and xeno languages. (Recall intent)
The main thing that stops the entire galaxy from just permanently devolving into this kind of linguistic madness is that the autotranslators have a limited battery life, which thankfully means one does have to worry about if they can communicate even after the battery runs out, and renders the "tan" language more of a party trick than serious endeavour.
Some ditch the audial component of language entirely, speaking entirely in thoughts. This is known as "Sylepathy" (From the word psychic and telepathy). The Galov is increasingly worried that humanity may be growing too dependent on the autotranslator, and has created its own language, "Standard" as a mandatory language for its government agents, drawn from a fusion of Latin, Anglish, and Greek, seeing overreliance on the autotranslator as potentially extremely dangerous as a single point of value.
Though everyday speech is generally fine, some cultural references, and subtle nuances still get lost. There's a standard monotone for when the autotranslator is trying to translate a concept that does not exist in your native language. And for important business contracts, the languages of choice are Anglish, Standard, Latin, Swingli (Standardized Neo-Swahili, for knowledge work), or Pancasian (Connected to line traders, more for trader/merchant work).

The Galactic Government (Galov)

The flag of the Galov is "The International Flag of Planet Earth", but with the Blue swapped for a dark pale purple. The 7 rings represent the 7 Tribes of Humanity. Humorously, it is said every single tribe claims its own tribe is the one in the center.

In an era where humanity is extremely divided by nationality and ethnic group, the one thing that can unify appears to be religion. And in this universe, there is actually a single entity that does claim the right of "Galactic Government", though their reign is very loose. Nations and worlds can and will defy the orders of the Galactic Government, and ultimately the Galactic Government can only pressure a world to do as they wish with military force.
The Galactic Government is a soft theocracy, but can demand very little of its subjects aside from occasional tax collections (Which are carried out with middling effectiveness.) and threatening them with military force. They're probably stronger than any one subtribe, but not the galaxy as a whole. For example, they could likely defeat any single member of the Prophet Follower subtribes, but are about the same level of strength as any one of the 7 tribes.
Unlike the Terran Tribes and Houses, the Galactic Government is unified enough to carry out big organizational tasks, and is probably the largest bureaucracy in the galaxy. The Galactic Government's main ideological purpose is to enforce the two iron laws. The law of human dignity, and the law of free will. Everything else, they are probably stretched too thin to do much for.

Their structure can be broken down between their 5 constituent faiths. Each faith has a symbolic capital, back on Earth which in theory they are linked to. In practice though, all 5 have vastly outgrown their symbolic capitals, and now have their true headquarters spanning entire planets.

There's also the scientific and military wing of the Galactic Government, who regulates technology and makes new breakthroughs.
-Researcher Corps (For Research)
-Technician Corps (For Maintenance/Engineering)

-Galactic Peacekeepers (Galactic Military)
-Galactic Agency (Special Forces, Galov Agents)

Which are sometimes said to form the 5 + 2 constituent ideologies that make up the Galov. With the Researchers and Technician Corps sometimes representing secular empiricism, and the Peacekeepers and Galactic Agency being militarism.

The Galov has a set of allied worlds, either worlds their 5 Faiths own directly, or that of an aligned government. All allied worlds pay tithes and give soldiers. (Standardized for directly owned. Negotiated for aligned governments.) In return, they get first priority on protection from the Peacekeepers, and the Galov are decent enough governors and managers. Becoming an allied world is semi-permanent, filing a request to cease being an allied world is difficult, both because the Galov is already slow, and because the Galov has a vested interest making sure no one leaves.
Their military arm are known as the Galactic Peacekeepers, a coalition of forces marshalled from allied worlds directly owned by the 5 constituent faiths, as well as friendly/allied governments. The Galactic Peacekeepers are the largest military force in the galaxy, though spread incredibly thin.
To maintain an idea of what's going on, they normally have their peacekeepers or agents go on "surveys" of local worlds to check what they're up to. On top of on their allied worlds, they have people who can report up the chain. Basically a "hey, we're still alive, things are chill" or "invasion inbound, please send help". The whole military is built on an "immune system" type response. No permanent occupations, only interventions when required.

Estimated forces of the Galov:
10 million Galov Agents (Biblically accurate angel, or Star Fighter power level. A single agent is normally enough to hold down a typical planet. These are sent on special missions.)
3 quintillion Peacekeepers (Ordinary soldiers. Generally top quality for the galactic average soldier. Armed with cutting edge technology and technologically advanced gear, though generally treated as infantry. The difference between Peacekeeper and typical world infantry can be thought of as the difference between American and Iraqi infantry. On paper, about 80,000 per world. In practice, most of them are on bases. The vast majority of worlds only has a thousand at most, for ceremonial roles and for recruitment drives.)

The doctrine of the Peacekeepers can be thought of like this. They're not intended for long-term occupations, nor are they intended to hold down worlds. But are instead normally stationed at various galactic bases owned by either the Galov, its Unifaiths, or other friendly entities, and are deployed as needed.
100 is recognized as the "golden number" of the upper limit of people who can be reasonably managed by a higher up. The structure for reporting up the chain of command looks like this.
There are 3.55 billion human inhabited worlds. (The Galov has self admitted "blind spots" around places such as the Black Earther zones, the Celestial Kingdom and the Sinocrats, and finally places like the Diamond Belt. Leaving about 2.7 billion worlds.)
These are then split up into about 270 sectors, with extra attention given to the fringes, or spaces outside major allied powers. Each sector commands about 10 million worlds. Peacekeepers are allocated to these sectors based on historical stability of the sector. Some have as few as 100 million Peacekeepers as a kind of "skeleton crew", brought out just for morale boosting or recruitment. The Galov is already thinking ahead to add another layer to the tree of scale, by grouping these 270 sectors into 3 "megasectors". Clearly anticipating for the day they may have up to 100 megasectors, before they need to start making mega-megasectors.
Each sector is then split into about 100 subsectors, which manages about 100,000 worlds each. From here, you have the star cluster offices, which manages about 1,000 worlds each. And then the star system offices, which can oversee 10 worlds each. Even the star system offices are mini bureaucracies, with hundreds of employees reporting on what's going on. (Normally just by connecting to the local planetary intranet and scrolling on the news.) From here, any information about an ongoing crisis or genocide can be relayed up the chain of command, and the lowest ranking capable of dealing with the issue is dispatched.

Due to the extreme decentralized nature of both the Galov, but also the peacekeeper core, officers from the star system office level all the way up to the sector level can have different philosophies on how to deal with local issues, leading to wildly different governing philosophies. Generally, the Galactic Peacekeepers try to mitigate this with a standardized civic education curriculum, with the civic education schools scattered across the galaxy. But even then, different schools have begun becoming known for being centers of different ideologies.

There's also the Transcribers Union, whose goal is to manage to culturally translate the religious works of the Great 5 and standardize their beliefs across every language, biology, psychology, etc. One of their greatest jobs is to transcribe a human-centric, Earth-centric religion (For example, Christianity) to millions of potential xenosophonts, and every configuration of human and transhuman possible across the galaxy. Digging into the purpose of metaphors, and finding appropriate equivalances in other cultures.
Notably, even this structure has severe blindspots. They have only moderate influence over the Sinocrats, who act mostly independently, they have a weak primarily cultural hold over the Sea People, and absolutely zero leverage against the Black Earthers. All nations act autonomously, or even independently at times, and they only have the ability to influence the galaxy, not govern it. They have no sway over the Diamond Belt, which are their own separate power bloc.

How the Galov Works:
The Galov maintains a larger scale than any single empire. Due to the fact that instead of nationality, or administration, the Galov's authority is derived from religion. And religion, generally speaking scales up much better than administration or ethnicity. The largest empire outside of the Galov, built on a more traditional empire model is likely the Celestial Kingdom, which contains about 4% of the human population. In comparison, the Galov is estimated to have about 15% of the galaxy's military power. (Both due to higher quality forces, but also because the Galov is able to draw on a thin wedge of a much larger pie. As well as the fact that the majority of states need to spend on social programs, while the Galov is primarily focused on military matters.)
The Galov operates on three streams of revenue. Tithes, core worlds, and direct revenue. Through its affiliated "Unifaiths", it draws tithes from about 30-40% of the population. Though the Unifaiths keeps much of this tithing revenue for itself, giving about only 5-10% to the Galov. The Moralintern is perhaps the one who is the most generous, giving about 30-35%. (Largely betting on the fact that this is an investment which will pay off from outsized galactic influence.)
The Galov also maintains core worlds, both ones influenced indirectly by its Unifaiths, and owned directly by the Galov itself. For these worlds, they can more directly tax them, though in return these core worlds get more direct management by the Galov, first priority for security breaches, and a more direct opportunity to influence galactic politics. These core worlds also provide much needed tax revenue.
Finally, direct revenue largely comes from donations, but also taxes levied on their Unibrands, which are allowed to operate at scale with the Galov's blessing. (Lest they be broken up forcibly by the Peacekeepers, or a hefty court case.) The Galov's single advantage is scale, it alone can operate at the scales it is currently at, and locks the gate for anyone who wants to scale up to the galactic level. It has a monopoly on scale through religion, and as all 5 of the Unifaiths are part of its coalition, it is nigh impossible to build another Galov of its scale.
The Galov largely thrives as the vast majority of people don't see a reason to challenge its rule. It doesn't take much in taxes, nor is it coercive. The Galov intentionally limits itself to enforcing two rules among all (human dignity, free will), and only a few extra rules among its own affiliated organizations. (Merchants must provide safety nets, warriors must have honor, priests must have humility, bureaucrats must have sortition.) As most people don't have an issue with its core two tenants, most people follow along. Even should the 5 Unifaiths splinter, the Galov is loose enough as an organization that they don't feel constrained by its dictates.
The tax revenue ends up being about 2-3% of the galactic GDP. While staggeringly massive in absolute terms, this is tiny for any government. As a result, the Galov adopts a nearly minarchist form of government. For one, it provides absolutely no social programs. Social programs are the responsibility of the local worlds, and while they are sometimes managed by the Galov, sometimes doing monetary transfers from one planet to another, they are not paid by the Galov. Other social programs are provided for by the Unifaiths (which have their own religion-based social safety programs) or by the Unibrands. (Who, by mandate are required to provide social safety nets once they reach a certain scale.)
(For a quick realism check, if the US government stripped out all social programs, and only focused on military and federal administration, you'd also get about 2-3%.)
The primary things the Galov spends money on are administration and its military/law enforcement, serving as an almost minarchist theocracy. It also scales back hard on which laws it enforces. By narrowing its focus primarily to human dignity, and free will, it leaves the vast majority of law enforcement to the local worlds. And given that 95% of worlds will not try to violate human dignity and free will by default, this is already a 95% cut. The brunt of their military is focused on suppressing, and punishing the remaining 5% (or perhaps 1%) who do intentionally try to challenge the rule of the Galov.
As the Galov does not levy direct taxes on most worlds, leaves almost everyone largely autonomous, and genuinely won't get in your way unless you do a genocide or mind control, most worlds just don't see an obvious incentive to anger the Galov. Those who do pay taxes join voluntarily, and also get more oversight from the Galov.
The rest of their budget goes to administration, which largely just manages the logistics of the Peacekeepers and the agents. The current balance is about 30% goes towards bureaucratic administration, and 60% goes towards the military, though this also includes R&D, pensions, and military administration. The last 10% goes towards miscellaneous costs such as education (Only for internal, not external training), hosting the Galactic Olympics, and things like that.

The Galovian "Exit Clause":
The Galov requests that no planets issue death penalties except in enforcement of its two iron laws. But not trusting simply telling them to do it, they instead give an incentive. They request if a planet wishes to deport any "undesirables", they can contact the Galov, and the Galov will pick them up by the thousands, and in exchange, the Galov will send over some pocket change. (The rough equivalent to about a hundred dollars a person. Not nothing, but would almost certainly be offset by a human being's contributions in tax revenue. They're both making "report it to the Galov" the most profitable way of human disposal (so bureaucrats don't just mass murder people as the cheaper option) but also make the reward low enough that no one is deporting people unless their expected value, whether for moral or economic reasons is worth "only" getting a hundred dollars for it.)
The reason the Galov does this is because it's aware it is very loosely governing a lot of truly regressive backwards worlds, and wants to give an "escape hatch" for regressive planets to vent out their undesirables and potentially relocate unorthodox individuals who are being persecuted to a more stable, open minded environment. The Galov uses the euphemism of "processing" so it actually gets viewed by the regressive worlds as a punishment, when what the Galov does is more complex than that. While also being more transparent to progressive worlds on what they're actually doing.
Once the "undesirables" are gathered up, the Galov begins sorting them. Some of them are genuine undesirables, probably shipped off to the Pleasure Worlds or some kind of prison/processing facility. But others are just bright individuals who had the displeasure of being born in a regressive area. The Galov basically offers them to be relocated to a nearby planet of their choice, rehabilitating them, giving them relevant training, informing them that the Galov does not condone the treatment they received, only asking that they eventually pay back the relocation costs (Probably worth about a few months worth of labor), or sometimes they'll just offer to recruit them outright.
The point of the Galov is not to enforce their way of life on everyone else, they don't have a way of life, though the Moralintern's weirdly cosmopolitan humanism is the closest thing to a "moral core", alongside the two Iron Principles. This is more to make sure that people who were abused on one world are eventually handed over by monetary incentives, so the Galov can apologize on behalf of the entire human race, then give them a second chance on a world of their choice.
The Processing centers tend to be pluralistic worlds with a generally inoffensive culture, where the "processed" are given medical treatment, education, therapy whatever they need to make a decision on where they want to choose as their final destination. Though plenty stay on the processing worlds themselves, seeing it as a perfectly good choice, and sometimes even volunteering to help out the processed people after them.

Aspects of the Imago Dei:
The Imago Dei are the attributes of God that have been found around the cosmos. It can interchangibly refer to the fundamental rights of dignity given to all sophontic beings, the marking of God upon the human soul, or the likeness or image of God. This focuses on the last one, as many different traditional aspects of God have been found across the cosmos. Of note, aside from the Rationalitas Dei, all of the following attributes seem impossible to evolve, and impossible to achieve if one does not have them innately. One simply has them, or does not.

Rationalitas Dei (Rationality of God) - This is the baseline for the Imago Dei, those with a level of intelligence and rationality akin to that of a human being. In accordance to the doctrine of the Imago Dei, all entities with such a level of intelligence are cherished and beloved creations of God, that must be respected as such. The only reason to intervene, in the Galov's eyes is if they are threatening the dignity of another child of the Imago Dei, or if their existence is unusually cruel or violates free will. This is how the Galov justifies the forced augmentation of monohumans, they consider their existence a violation of dignity that must be amended.
The Galov has an exceptionally large list of entities they consider to be under the umbrella of the Rationalitas Dei, and are therefore bound to the standards of human dignity, or some kind of rough equivalent.
Entities protected under the Imago Dei:
-All Humans, and all Human-Derived/Emulating Entities. (Transhumans, Orhumans, Monohumans, Human Digital Copies, Terramachines.)
-Any Xenosophont with a sense of self preservation.
-Any digital or artificial being with true consciousness (measurable by presence of a soul/qualia) and self preservation.
Those without any sense of self, or self preservation are considered outside the Imago Dei. To degrade a member of the Imago Dei to a level below the Imago Dei (torture, de-evolution, lobotomization) is considered among the gravest of sins.
"All are beloved, all must be respected. They are children of God. We correct sin, *because* they are children of God."

Facultas Creandi (Ability of Creation) - Ability to create new things, to partake in creation as God does. Humans have this ability, as do human-built intelligent machines, that seem to inherit this ability through the Imago Hominis. Most of humanity's civilization-building, non xenoexotic cousins also have this ability. Notably, the Angels and the Demons do not, and this seems to be an ability mostly limited to the civilization building species.

Claves Creationis (Keys to Creation) - This is the ability to think and reason abstractly, to grasp rationality enough that one can re-engineer the rules of the universe. This allows for the formalization of science, mathematics, and the laws of physics. Though many of humanity's cousins are holders of the keys in some form, humanity's psychological makeup seems uniquely capable of intuiting the axioms, forming perfectly explanatory mathematical models. Many other species instead use very close approximations, or brute "trial and error" science as opposed to mathematical extrapolation.

Humanity possesses the Rationalitas, the Facultas, and Claves. But there are two more that have been discovered, that humanity does not possess.

Omniscience - Found in: Luciferians (Local), Lucifer (Universal). Defined as Hyperturing awareness, having the answer to any question not involving free will, or logical paradoxes. The Luciferians that predated Lucifer had the ability to gain omniscient knowledge by interaction, gaining total knowledge about any physical object. The fusion of the gestalt consciousness into Lucifer took this one step further, giving Lucifer total present knowledge. Lucifer also gained the ability to read minds, though not perfectly predict the future, or see what decision one would make. (which was unknown, due to free will.) Lucifer did not possess the Facultas, nor the Claves. As a result, he was reliant on another race, known as the "Constructors" to build anything. Lucifer could only copy or corrupt, never create.

Omnipresence - Found in: Angels. The Angels are enigmatic entities, not locally bound, and having the ability to manifest anywhere in the universe both in space, and time. Despite this, the Angels are largely observers, lacking the creative drive nor ambition to do anything with this power. Angels do not possess the Facultas, nor the Claves.
Note: While these entities are functionally immortal, destroying the body of an Angel in a specific location will prevent them from manifesting in that location again. The "field" their manifestations are disturbances of are anchored to local gravity wells, meaning that regardless of a planet's movement in space, destroying an angel's body at say, the White House will prevent them from manifesting again at the White House. More interestingly, you can force them to manifest with certain techniques.

There are two more theoretical aspects of God, that have not been found anywhere in the universe.

Omnibenevolence - It appears all races sin. An alternative explanation, proposed by some Darwinian philosophers suggests that capacity for love grows as one gets stronger. Love is only possible when you are in a strong, and secure enough position to love others without risking your own existence. And that no species has achieved the level of infinite power needed to become omnibenevolent. This power therefore seems to be the sole domain of God.

Omnipotence - God is alone in this. Though some suggest that those who have the Rationalitas, the Facultas, and Claves may begin to approach this as they advance. These thinkers tend to align with the Spiral Mandate thesis.

The Council of Cayenne:
The discovery of extraterrestrial life shocked the Christian world, leading to a scramble for a ecumenical consensus. What became a few isolated examples became a flood, as humanity came upon tens, and then hundreds of xenosophontic species. In light of this overwhelming discovery, the Christian churches convened for an ecumenical council for the first time in millennia, at the Council of Cayenne in the year 2671. Chosen for its symbolic location in the New World, but also its close proximity to the American Spaceport in now American Guiana.
The denominations that adopted the doctrine are known as "Cayennian Christians", and are the vast majority of Christian denominations. Including but not limited to the Roman Catholics, most Protestant Denominations, and most Orthodox Churches. Non-Cayennians are a fringe minority, mostly of human-exclusivist sects or other heterodox interpretations.
Their Findings:
1. To our dismay, the fallen state of the world is not only limited to Earth. We have observed the fallen state extends to the entire universe. With regret, the council concludes that extraterrestials are also fallen. They murder, they lie, they disbelieve. The mandate of the church is not just to Earth, but to the universe. The depravity of creation not only applies to humanity, but seemingly, all life.
2. We affirm the cosmic uniqueness of the Christ resurrection event. We affirm that Christ's sacrifice is enough not only for humanity, but the redemption of all creation. (Whether Christ could appear to other worlds, and incarnate multiple times for multiple worlds is a disputed matter outside the findings of the council.)
To create a framework on how humans should see themselves in relation to the cosmos, the Cosmic Gentile Doctrine was created.
1. Humans are one species, subordinate to and under God; author of all Creation.
2. Humans are the xenos what the Jews were to the Gentiles. Called first, and called to the truth. But God's compassion does not extend to humans alone. God's wish, just as it was for the gentiles was that all creation know him. Though the Jews were first, they are not superior.
3. It is now the mandate of the cosmic Jews to preach the gospel to the cosmic Gentiles. Just as Paul brought the gospel to the Gentiles, humanity is now called to bring the gospel to the cosmos.

It draws up three parallels:
1. Humanity as Cosmic Jews. First, but not superior, instead being weighed down with special responsibility. They are to create the Cosmic Church, and ensure the new xenos being grafted in live righteously. God may have first came to them, but they also bear the guilt for crucifying him.
2. Aliens as the Cosmic Gentiles. They did not know, it is our job to bring it to them. Though God forgives ignorance, the time of ignorance has ended. Mankind will spread the cosmic truth, and bring them into the cosmic fold.
3. Xenoreligions (Especially monotheistic ones with remarkable similarities) as Gentile God-fearers, or pre-Christian prophets. On rare occasions, humanity has encountered religions with a remarkable similarity to Christianity. These are treated as pre-Christ visions of God, or natural theology built up from conscience. The church acknowledges these groups as legitimate for their time, but as the true gospel is here, all are expected to embrace the faith.

The Universal Translation Bible:
This is a fill in the blank, digital Bible. Basically, it's a version of the Bible, but with all the cultural specific nouns stripped out, literally left as blanks. You're meant to study a culture first, and as you do, you fill in the blanks until you get a Bible that is close enough to their species-wide context. The blanks are at the front page, and any blanks you fill in will automatically populate the rest of the Bible, along with a helpful blurb that describes what it represents in a non-cultural specific way. For example, "mana" is a kind of generic, inoffensive food. Bread can be its closest equivalent, but can be filled in with a similar, or even the same substance as mana. Wine is preferrably fermented, but can be replaced with any "non-baseline" drink. Lambs are a passive animal that represents innocence.
It also gives helpful guides on how to universalize Christian morality. For marriage, especially among non-monogamous species, it recommends looking into natural law to formulate an alien equivalent, emphasizing the single loyalty and commitment, as opposed to the literal mechanics of it. It does have a few iron laws it refuses to cross, however. The Noahide Laws are generally used as a guide for universal laws that apply to all aliens. And goes so far as to advocate for genetic augmentation should an alien biology make them physically incapable of following these. (For example, a species that habitually eats their young.)

The Xenoevangelism Arms Race:
The Great Faiths of Earth are playing a game. A game for the souls of countless quadrillions of xenosophonts. Though xenos only make up 3% of the Galov's population, winning them over is not only a welcome addition, but also a symbolic victory for the faith in question. Out of the 5 Great Unifaiths, 4 are engaged in the great race. The Christian Moralintern and the Roman Catholics both work together and compete for the Christian faith. Islam and Buddhism also threw their hat into the ring, with Buddhism in particular betting large on large amounts of xeno conversion to balance out their smaller human population numbers. Hinduism alone has largely opted to stay out of the arms race, as Hinduism has historically never been strong in evangelism, and is deeply rooted in the practices of a particular culture.
Outside of the 5 unifaiths, there are others that participate. The Mormons, and the Ba'hais are two of the most prominent. As are the Atheists, equipped not with a holy book, but empiricism, to inoculate their minds against religion before the holy men reach them. Each religion with their own strengths and weaknesses, we can judge the state of the current Arms Race. The following is the compiled xenosophont religious data from the Galovian Census.

Religion of the Galov Xenosophonts:
41% Xenoreligion (Other)
21% Xenobuddhism
17% Christianity (11% Protestant/"Just Christian", 6% Catholic)
8% Buddhism ("Hard" Buddhism, closer to how humans practice it, rather than soft Buddhist vibes)
6% Irreligious/Atheist (In the human sense)
6% Other (Mostly Ba'hai, JWs and Mormons, all heavily dispreportionately represented among xeno populations.)
1% Islam (Dawah-gandist sources claim up to 10%)

Below is a breakdown of the strengths and weaknesses of the main competitors of the Xenoevangelism Arms Race.

Xenoreligion:
Xenoreligion is the default in many xeno societies, though in most cases, xenoreligion is a lifestyle, not a faith in the human sense. Many people who are xenoreligious are essentially irreligious by internal belief, but still function as practitioners of a xenoreligion. "True" irreligious/atheists, in the human sense have been seperated out, and categorized as its own thing.

Buddhism:
Buddhism has surprisingly come out on top, an abnormality, as Buddhism has been somewhat weak at maintaining its own core human base, but has made up to it by becoming an increasingly xeno-friendly religion. Their biggest advantage is the extreme ease of conversion, relative to other faiths. The core essential doctrine of "suffering comes from desire, relinguish desire to escape the cycle of suffering" is surprisingly universal. Almost all species, regardless of biology have some form of suffering and desire, making this extremely easy to translate. Buddhism lacks the strong institutional backing of Christianity, but make up for it in sheer evangelism power. The downside is that many xenos get stuck on this first step, creating a distinct branch known as "Xenobuddhism", a very thin, stripped down version of Buddhism that essentially consists of the core tenant of "release oneself from desire to alleviate suffering" and leaves it at that.

Christianity:
Christianity has the tremendous advantage of having enormous institutional backing, with strong evangelism institutions and an organized infrastructure to take on as many xenosophonts as possible. The main hurdle is the difficulty of translation, as many concepts such as marriage, lamb, sacrifice, and crucification need careful translation, and is far more complex than Buddhism's easy drag and drop theology. The time needed to properly investigate cultures and to ensure the texts are properly translated is a major hurdle, and a major thing slowing them down. On top of this, Christianity is higher commitment than Buddhism, commitments which may be incompatible with an alien's biology. Christianity is seemingly hitting a hard wall against who they can convert, but they do have the institutions and determinations to break down that wall wherever possible.

Islam:
Islam has had profound difficulties preaching to the xeno audience. One of which is the inerrancy of the Quran, making justifying a "universal translation version" theologically awkward, though many "xeno-adapted translations" are treated in the same way as say, an English translation of the Arabic. Many of the requirements of Islam is hard to justify to xenos audiences, and many conservative theologians believe this goes against the principle of Quran clarity. Various Dawah groups claim a much higher conversion percentage, normally by getting xenos to recite the Shahada. Though follow up interviews have found that the adherance to this does not extend much further than a simple recitation.

Religion and Status Hierarchy:
Studies have found that xenoreligion is less about faith, and more about socioeconomic signalling, as seen in the stark class divide in religion. Generally speaking, xenos can send one of a few signals. Practicing xenoreligion is a signal of planetary/species pride, and a desire to exist outside the human paradigm. If one wants to signal that they are "assimilated" into the human project, and to signal a sense of "modernity", but with the minimal amount of obligations or lifestyle changes, Xenobuddhism tends to be the case. For those who wish to signal "high status" or signal that they are assimilated parts of the "Galactic community", Christianity tends to be the religion of choice, as the Galov's Christian institutions are the most established, and conversion is an easy gateway into many private networks.

Deontological-Utilitarianism:
The Galov largely collapses the distinction between Deontological and Utilitarian ethics. Their two strongest iron laws are justified deontologically. Those being the Imago Dei (Inherent dignity and value of every being with self preservation and human-level intelligence), and Free Will. (The mandate that God does not coerce men to follow Him, and therefore, neither does the Galov have any authority to.) These principles stem not from the Galov, but from God, making them axioms that cannot be revoked, even by the individuals themselves, and will be enforced regardless of consent. (An individual cannot consentually relinguish their Imago Dei nor their Free Will, as consent is irrelevant. These are mandates from God, and cannot be legitimately overridden even by the individual themselves.)
Yet they also have good arguments for the utilitarian argument for these. Inherent dignity encourages pluralism, maximizing the cooperation of people, and increasing orthogonality, making humanity less predictable, controllable, and therefore more resilient to thoughts. Free Will also encourages pluralism, also increasing orthogonality. To the Galov, the universe runs (mostly) in accordance to the rules set down by God. If it is good, then it will be useful and beneficial. If it is beneficial, it is good. They collapse the distinction between deontological and utilitarian. To them, these are the same things. Many things which seem utilitarian in the moment, yet violate their deontological mandate, they argue, will become detrimental and un-utilitarian in the long run.
As for proof that the Galov is currently aligned with the ways of God, they cite that their mandate of pluralism has proven more robust than other systems. Though they always acknowledge their ability to go astray, and that God will punish them when (not if) they make errors.

Pleasure Worlds:
The Galov is rather tolerant of most political ideologies across the galaxy. But the one they do not tolerate is hedonism. They do not see hedonism as a crime the same way other things are a crime. Normal crimes go to normal prisons. No, this is a spiritual sickness, and there is only one cure. The Galov will tolerate communist movements that still require a form of struggle (The strange strains of Muscular, or Darwinian Communism are allowed), but for most communists, especially the secular progressive variety, this is their fate.
The Pleasure worlds serve as a quarantine, where automated benevolent/hedonistic AIs run factories without regulation or care. Where they're allowed to indulge themselves on whatever it is they please. The Galov do not regulate these worlds. Why would they? They let them fulfill their utopian promises as they please, whatever form of "true communism" they seek. They only arm the door, to prevent revolutionaries from smuggling this dangerous technology out of their designated grave. A concentration camp for the soul.
The old population burns away, their brains fried by pleasure pods, fatty and bloated from years of gorging on the finest foods, atrophied and braindead from endless pleasure. New kindling comes in every day, a burning fire, a quarantine to protect the rest of the galaxy.
People are free to come and go as they please. But if they want to leave, they must be re-educated to reintegrate with galactic society. Very few prisoners ever leave. Some people visit the pleasure worlds, only to leave in disgust at what they see from the so-called "humans".
The Galov is of mixed opinion on how to approach these Pleasure Worlds. Generally, it depends on the local Galov administrator. Some, of the more humanitarian persuasion see it more as a rehabilitation center. Others, of the more hardliner faction see it as a form of natural selection, to give them exactly what they want. Until even their souls burn away. Ironically, those who rehabilitate run their own pleasure worlds like a regular prison, with doctors and regular exercise, where luxuries are massively restricted, while it is the hardliners that provide paradise.
"Let them burn away their souls. Their spirit, their body, eventually even their humanity will be burned away. I've never had to kill a human before, because these are not humans."
There is never a lack of pleasure worlds, as any given planet has a small chance of becoming hedonistic. (>0.0001% and falling, as hedonism is slowly burned out of the human gene pool.) Once it reaches the abundance collapse threshold, the Galov secures it, and it bcomes another pleasure world, for the processing of the spiritually sick and unclean.

Great Empires and Nation-Polities of the Galaxy:

These empires are strong enough that not even the Galactic Government will try to mess with them, unless they're ready to sink a significant amount of their forces to put them down. These empires, cumulatively, make up around 10% of human space's volume.

Galov Aligned:
-The Great Constellation: The closest thing to a Star People empire, mostly made up of a massive confederation of African-descended groups. Though the Constellation is close to a normal democracy, it's greatest difference is its Griot Council, analogous to the American Senate with veto power over legislation, but dictated by the chosen elders of every world. Due to the heavy focus on decentralization, each Griot World is given a high amount of autonomy.
-The Eurocratic Federation: A more traditional democratic, representative, (bureaucratic), federal democracy. All the tropes you've come to love. Federal planet-provinces, representatives, parliaments, a smug sense of democratic superiority. Even has its own federalized military corp called the Eurocorps. They're somewhere of a hybrid between the Star Trek Federation and the European Union.

Galov Neutral:
-Celestial Kingdom: The Celestial Kingdom is massive, and the Galactic Government has little/no influence over it. All they can do is mostly avoid them.

Galov Hostile:
-Diamond Belt: Started out as an alliance of Transhuman groups, but eventually became a empire of the Diamondgrass Family and her Lunarians, over the rest of the Transhuman groups, operating almost like an old style aristocratic monarchy.

Defunct Empires:
-Empire of Light: Before its fragmentation, the Empire of Light was a state too powerful to attack, and was largely ignored. The Empire of Light's downfall did not come from the Galactic Government, but pissing off enough peer-level nations that it eventually got hacked apart.
-The Great Khan: This was less of an empire and more of a moving army. Of an unstoppable army, and the numerous worlds that laid under him. The Great Khan was both a great conquerer, but also delegator. He was tolerant and pluralistic, wanting to unify the galaxy under his rule. In the late days of his reign, he gathered together the strongest religions of the galaxy, shortly before he died. In fact, it was this assembly of religions that would end up becoming the modern Galactic Government, though the modern Galactic Government tries to downplay these roots.

Citadel System:
The de-facto capital system of the Galov (Galactic Government), it's a massively terraformed system, where every planet and surface has been augmented to become habitable. Here, the infrastructure and bureaucracy needed to manage a galaxy of 40 quintillion people spanned entire worlds. The core world is simply named "Heycue Prime", which orbits a brilliant Jupiter-like gas giant named "Heycue" (thought to be a corruption of the word "HQ"), with blue-white bands (Type II gas giant). Because humans gotta human, the habitable planet is sometimes synonymous or confused with the gas giant.
There are others, Secund, Terti, all the way up to Septim. Massive megastructures are scattered across the system, housing the Galov offices of the 5 Unifaiths, multiple Unibrand headquarters, the official headquarters of the Galactic Peacekeepers, the Galactic Agency, the Orthogonal Research Division, and is essentially the central headquarters of the Galov. The 5 Unifaiths have their own capitals on Orthello/Lithone, Petram, Al-A'la, Shunya, and Akshara.
Citadel is probably one of the most fiercely defended systems in the galaxy. Between Starfleet Citadel (The local starfleet garrison), being the headquarters of the Galactic Peacekeepers, housing anywhere from 100 million to 1 billion peacekeepers on any given day, having at least 1000 Galov superhuman Agents on any given day.
On top of the Citadel Elite Guard, Peacekeeper Elite Divisions, the personal Ecclesiarchal forces of the 5 Unifaiths, the total forces of several megacorporations worth of mercenaries (Due to it housing the corporate headquarters of several mercenary organizations), an enormous amount of experimental Orhumans, experimental weapons and the combined forces of the Orthogonal Research Division. Not to mention the extreme amounts of orbital weapons that would be present at effectively every corner.
The only system that may have stronger defenses are that of Old Sol itself.

Defenses of the Solar System:
As the ancestral home system of the human species, the Solar System is perhaps the only system that can rally more forces than even the combined Galov. The Solar System is home to several superpowers in their own right. Mars, with its connection to half the Star People diaspora, and the ability to call in nearly every mercenary in the galaxy. (As Mars is the centralized hub of most private military corporations, and is the headquarters of the "Milintern", the galaxy's largest mercenary association.) Luna, as the home of the Lunar Library, the largest collection of knowledge in the galaxy, host of the Librarian Order, the Omnithecia, and who run their own orthogonal research division, and likely houses technology unknown even to the Galov.
And finally, Earth itself, whose onion layer-like orbital rings house 10 quadrillion people, where all of the oldest corporations and institutions conglomorate into a single location, and whose governor acts more like an symbolic leader to all humanity. Who hosts technology that is unknown to even the Lunarians, and whose surface has been hardened by the densest conglomoration of orbital defenses known to man. This is not to mention the other great powers of the Solar System. The Terran Orbitals above Earth orbit, a collection of orbital habitats that host another 10 quintillion, would surely also mobilize should the Solar System become threatened. Venus, Ceres, Mercury, Titan, Europa, Io, and countless, countless others are all major powers in their own right. Not as strong as the three heavyweights of Earth, Mars, and Luna, but still with considerably influence and resources. Nearly every body, every asteroid, and even multiple gas giants, even the Sun itself has been settled to some degree.
Yet this is still not the Solar System's trump card. The Earth, as the ancestral home to humanity has the ability to invoke the "Pact of the Sons of Man", a galaxy wide call to arms that obligates all life that descends from Earth to return in order to defend it. Should humanity ever fall, it will surely be at the packed defenses of Earth, where mother Earth and her 40 quintillion kin shall make their final stand.

Governorship of Earth:
Earth was able to reunify sometime after the Conquest of the Great Khan. Its governor elected by a council of old Earth regions. (Electors from all of the 7 continents.) Despite its relatively modest size in terms of sheer territory (Being a planet-state), Earth still remains a heavyweight in the realm of diplomacy. Earth even to this day retains one of humanity's most built up population and industrial bases. (Approaching 10 quadrillion people as of contemporary times, more than many stellar nations.) And this is before one considers Earth's symbolic position. No other man is as close to being a true leader of the human race. Even if Earth does not actively control them, Earth commands so much respect that the word of the governor could mobilize a million worlds. Aside from the big nations, there are perhaps a few million independent worlds, many of which are loyal to an idea of human nationalism, and defer their decisions to Earth. And it is for this reason that even the Galactic Government fears Earth, and there exists some tension between who exactly is the true authority of the galaxy. Earth so far has not invoked this power, as the symbolic leader of the human race, but as more ambitious governors take the throne, the Galactic Government worries about whether Earth will sidestep their immense power. The Earth is also not shy in their own arsenal of exotic weapons. Being the most developed world in the entire galaxy, where the galactic bureaucracy was once run, being the site of incorporation of over a million galaxy-spanning institutions and corporations, the institutional power of Earth runs deep. No other planet has this concentration of raw power. And deep within the depths of Earth, are secrets that make even the Galactic Government shudder.

Earth has a very broken way of making money. Almost all of its revenue is received by a land tax. Given how many "Heritage Foundations" basically rent bits and bobs of land from the Earth, and how many institutions like the Bethlehem Foundation, the Roman Catholic Church, and several religious organizations need to rent their own holy sites back from Earth, the Earth receives an amount of tax money enough to rival even the Galov.

The Star Wanderers:
Other names: Yanglos, Yanklos, Yankos, "Y".
A subset of the Star Peoples that have now wandered out far beyond human controlled space. They were the explorer spirit of mankind distilled into permanent wanderers. Keeping track of them is difficult, as they expand outwards roughly at however fast the rate that FTL technology will let them. The Spindlers have confirmed that they have encountered Star Wanderers much further out than "normal" humanity.
They fly a flag of red, white, and blue. It's become a tradition to gift a flag at birth with the blue canon blank, and to fill it in with the stars you find, eventually encompassing thousands of stars as one ages. They've been described as loud, expressive, but generally friendly. They are humanity's first contact with much of the galaxy, long before the Galov can follow behind them.
As they name every star they come across, the "Yanglo Designation System" has been used for giving interim names to stars before they can be properly named. Almost every star baseline humanity finds has normally already been seen by an earlier Yanglo explorer, resulting in names such as YD-Chago-82. (The Yanglos aren't that creative, and they tend to reuse a lot of names. There was once an entire star cluster of well over 50 stars in close proximity, all named Bob.)

The Babel Cluster:
"I am absolutely convinced, and you cannot convince me otherwise, that the Babel Cluster is one massive elaborate prank on the entire galaxy, played by the Yankos." -Galov representative.
As we all know, the Galov is fairly fond of the Yanglo Designation System. AKA, "We can't decide on a name for now, let's let these Yankee rednecks choose the interim name until we figure something out". Well, the Yanglos found out about this, and they didn't take this as a sign of offense, but instead as a great opportunity for trolling. When the Galov came across the Babel cluster, they began looking through the Yanglo archives and looking for what the name is.
"What the... No, what? You can't have... GODDAMN YANKOS!" -Galov surveyer.
Here is a non-exhausive list of the names they gave to the stars and planets in the Babel Cluster, and what the Yanglo Designation System eventually turned them into, after much headaches from the Galov.
"))))))))))))))))))))))))))" -> YD-Right Bracket-27
"'); DROP TABLES Stars;--" -> YD-Droptables
Literally just the numbers 1 through 512 -> YD-Babel-1, 2, 3, etc. (The worst part was that they intentionally left out 211, 213, and 279. The Galov spent YEARS chasing them down before realizing they just didn't exist.
"Bob" (They named 129 stars, "Bob".) -> YD-Babel-Bob-1, Bob-2, etc. (The even worse part is that they intentionally chose the most similar stars possible to be named Bob. Making them even harder to distinguish. All of them were nearly identical in mass, and physically close, and were all yellow dwarves, the most useful kind of star.)
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" -> YD-dQw-Astley (An employee didn't get the joke and typed it in at the office.)
"Delete System32" -> YD-Babel-System32 (No comment.)
"rmdir C:\Windows\System32 /s /q" -> YD-Babel-32rmdir (An employee actually didn't know what the command did, bricking his system.)
"𰻝" -> YD-Babel-Biang ("What the actual f---.")
 -> YD-Babel Null (Their device was straight up giving them an error. And they thought it was busted until they realized the Yanglos put in a name of literally nothing.)
And many, many more.

Newtonshifting, and Beacons:
The dominant form of FTL by Galovian humanity, and generally the most energy efficient. When the Roasians first showed up with the jump gates, humanity attempted to replicate it, only to find the energy demands utterly impossible. Jump gates required dumping an enormous amount of energy, and exotic matter humanity simply doesn't have. (And still does not have, nearly a millennia later.)
Due to the non-overlapping, and orthogonal nature of their tech trees, humanity began to brainstorm other ways to engage in FTL travel, and came up with the concept of "Newtonshifting". By "vibrating" matter at a certain frequency, a macroscopic object can transfer itself to a different frequency of reality, in this case entering what is known as "Newton state". In this state, the macroscopic object exists as a ghostly apparition in real space, yet unable to interact with physical reality. While under Newston state, light is infinitely fast in all directions, though the ship becomes completely blind to anything in realspace, a consequence of the Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis. Broadcasts from Newtonspace to realspace are impossible, as the censorship going in also causes censorship going out.
In Newtonspace, travel is merely about how much delta v you carry with you, as the speed is uncapped, and one can go as fast as you want. You must slow down to light speed or lower in order to re-enter realspace, as well as pay for the "transfer fee", which happens to be the difference between the regular kinetic energy formula and the relativistic kinetic energy formula. If you don't pay the fee, you simply don't shift. In practice, this means exiting Newtonspace when above the speed of light is impossible, and that you really want to slow down as much as possible. Due to the rather empty nature of Newtonspace, and the impossibility of slowing down if you're out of fuel, ships being stranded forever in Newtonspace is not unheard of.
Due to the IMMENSE distances involved in Newtonshifting, and complete lack of outside observation during the journey, the Galov has constructed Beacons, massive houses of light anchored in realspace that shine in Newtonspace just to guide the way. With a beacon, you will reliably make sure you get to the right place. Without one, you're effectively praying your computer got the calculations right, that the Galactic Atlas has the exact decimal points, potentially warping 10 ly outside of a star. And then doing several more Newton jumps (This is after you expended a lot of delta v just to slow down, only to speed up and slow down again) to get closer and closer until you give up and settle for using sublight the rest of the way.
Some experienced travellers swear there is are "lines" to Newtonspace, that one can trace almost like a grid to orient themselves, improving their accuracy and increasing their ability to navigate. These become known as the Line Travellers, and are generally considered some of the most important professions.
Alert stations in Newtonspace are effectively little switches in Newtonspace that look out for SOS broadcasts in Newtonspace, and once found, will shift back into realspace, alerting realspace to begin mobilizing a rescue mission. For obvious reasons, these kinds of patrols are only possible in settled space. When you're stranded in the frontier void, you're on your own. And given the size of space, there is very little chance anyone will ever find you.

Portal travel:
As it turns out, Roas just happened to be right next to an extremely valuable "exotic matter mine", seemingly a construct left over from a now long dead precursor race. To this day, no other source of exotic matter has been produced, even with a thousand years of advanced technology. And exotic matter is very, very carefully rationed by the Galov for the most dire of emergency situations.

The Galov Standardized Invention Database, and the Galactic Innovation Synchronization Initiative:
With billions of worlds, quintillions of people, and spotty communication, the Galov faced a problem with coordination of innovation. It wasn't that they couldn't build enough infrastructure to allow for instant, cross galaxy communication. Oh no, the problem was noise. There was just so much information sloshing around, almost anything could be lost to the static. This created a condundrum, when their entire goal was to push the frontiers of human orthogonality, an idea researched twice was wasted effort, and the Galov desired that once an innovation was made, it be made available to the entire galaxy as soon as possible.
Ownership over new discoveries was not really enforcible anymore for the following reason. Innovation was largely about having the right foundational ideas, and then making the same breakthrough at the right place, at the right time. The past consecutive 100 Nobel Prizes have been awarded to groups of hundreds if not thousands, as they all had the same discovery independently, and no one can verify who came first. It was the Newton-Leibniz problem, but on a galactic scale.
To ensure humanity's minds were always focused on solving the new, rather than relitigating the old, the Galov needed a way for humanity to know exactly what had been discovered, and what had not. Introducing, the Standardized Invention Database. It was a large database of standardized versions of all of humanity's inventions. Inventors who submitted could get their name on a page of history, as this was one of the few ways an individual could be mentioned on a galactic scale. And given that hundreds of inventors may be coming across the same invention concurrently, and submissions were open to anyone in the public who could describe its assembly, the Galov only needed one of them to submit.
After a brief check to make sure it was useful, descriptive, and checked all the correct boxes, the invention would be listed as "unverified" on the database. Planets browsing the database can then check whether these unverified inventions worked or not, sending positive or negative votes based on whether they were able to replicate it. If it reaches X votes, it is "verified", if it reaches -X votes, it is re-evaluated for plausibility, and sent back to the inventor for further clarification. X is determined by how many people flood in every morning to instantly press up or downvote, and votes are given to planets, not individuals. Of note, it can still be voted on after it's verified. So you can only psyop a "good" invention for so long before the collective weight of the galaxy, angry that their labs just blew up drags the score back into hell. (For reference, the largest empire in the galaxy, has only about 2% of the human population. Not even a nation state could pull this off.) The Galov is entirely aware bad actors exist, so there also exists a moderation team to check out the inventions that get negative scores. (Preventing vested interests from suppressing inventions.)
The intended use of this database is to be exported as a service to each planet that pays for the service (It is not free, but is the equivalent of a few thousand dollars per world, not nearly a bank-breaking expense), where each planet preserves a local copy for the planetary population to use, with weekly or monthly updates from the Galov keeping the databases up to date. (Technically, given the whole thing will be downloaded, there's nothing stopping a planet from just downloading a local version and only paying once, but then it would drift out of sync.) Any inventors looking for useful devices for an experiment, or just something to build off of can browse the database to help do things, or, companies can browse it to see if there is a solution, and begin building.
Due to the near impossibility of litigating Galactic IP law, the Galov has decided to let IP be a local, or planetary thing. Each planet may or may not run its own patent office. Some planets or nations don't even recognize IP (The Copyleft movement). Some empires share IP databases. The Galov has no ability, nor interest in enforcing galactic intellectual property rights. Its budget is stretched thin enough as is, and proving who was "first" to copyright an idea would come down to the microsecond.
Plenty of people do still file local patents or even copyright, if just for the privilege of being the exclusive provider of a service on that world or larger nation. But if they want to go galactic, or to service a much larger audience, they must become a Unibrand, under the regulation and attention of the Galov. And the Galov basically tells them to give up on IP. "It's more hassle than it's worth, and not even we have the money to enforce it galaxy wide." And the Galov generally favors local planetary brands and economies over large expansive corporations anyway. The galaxy is effectively post scarcity and voluntarily scarce, Unibrands are more sold on reliability, prestige, or brand loyalty.

The Research Frontier Map:
This is attached to the Galov Standardized Invention Database. It's just a pop up where you're asked to fill out a survey when you open the application. Basically: "What are you studying at the moment". These get processed by an LLM, grouped together if they're basically equivalent, and then it's displayed exactly what the galaxy is working on. It suggests where innovation is not yet allocated, which areas are perhaps too hot, that sort of thing. It's mostly an almost free market way to distribute the galaxy's brainpower by giving them a snapshot of "hey, this is exactly what is being researched, and what is not".

Conceptual Saturation Attack:
Even more impressive is how the Database got weaponized for war. The Galov's preferred way of attack is what is known as a "conceptual saturation attack". In other words: "Throw everything and see what sticks!" New galactic threat pops up, new tab on the database. "Hey! Help us brainstorm how to kill this thing! Upvote if it works, downvote if it does not." Like some poor eldritch horror is trying to munch on a local Solar System before they get bombarded by 100,000 different weapons at once. Someone figures out what works, replicates them, and now they have 1,000,000 of that thing incoming. This is why fighting the Galov and humanity as a whole is a headache. Yeah, you can figure out how to counter or short circuit one thing, but can you counter a million things? At once? And it's constantly changing?

The Librarians:
The Librarians are a secretive, galaxy spanning organization whose main goal is the collection and usage of knowledge and memory. They're often associated with and conditionally work with the Galactic Technician or Researcher Corps, but the latter do not fully trust the Librarians, seeing them as untrustworthy with their own agenda. Their headquarters is on Old Luna, literally looking down on the Earth below. The Librarians are in charge of the great Lunar Library, also known as the Omnithecia, the largest collection of knowledge in the galaxy, even larger than the Galactic Government's own collection.
Their order is known to be all-women, and to never engage in physical combat, instead spinning a complex web of alliances to have others fight on their behalf. It's suspected the Librarians are involved with the Lilith Belt. Allegedly to "gather more datapoints about the limits of human experience."

The Lilith Belt:
The Lilith Belt, much like the Diamond Belt, is another string of worlds controlled by an "alternate" group of people. In this case, a string of worlds controlled by female-dominant factions, or various "alt" orientations for the human species. The Lilith Belt is where much of the Galactic Government's forces are allocated, fighting insurgents.
-Red Anarchists (Dye their hair red to show their allegience. Anti-social rebels.)
-Lilith Republic (The namesake, a vaguely progressive gynocratic republic at constant war with the Galactic Government. Calls the Diamond Belt "sellouts".)
--Sisters of Lilith (Their combat wing.)
--Transversals (Every single person is *required* to be the opposite gender of their sex at birth. The Galactic Government calls this "industrialized mass psychological torture".)
-Oridiversal Union (Refugee center for those of alternative orientations and allied groups. Is seen as more amicable than the other groups of the Lilith Belt.)
-Gem Fragments (Refugees from the Diamondgrass Dynasty, just radical transhumanist ethnonationalist extremists.)

The Neurohumans, and the Augments:
"God has made you different, and that is beautiful. Just as I may have been made with different skin than my peers, or different hair, or different height; so too, has God given you your own gifts. Let every limitation become a gift, and let every hardship become motivation, to push the boundaries a little harder." -Moral Overseer of the Moralintern, addressing a crowd of Neurohumans and Augments.
The Neurohumans and the Augments are one of the stranger aspects of the Galov. Where others see a crippling condition, the Galov sees a gift. A chance to strap something new there where they wasn't before. Neurohumans (known as Neurodivergents in previous eras) are used to oversee much of the Orhuman program, detailed later in this document. They're prized for alternative perspectives, yet also scrutinized to ensure correspondance to reality.
Augments are those who are born with a more physical condition (Called the disabled in previous eras), and for the Galov, they are a chance to experiment with transhuman augmentation. There is an entire section of the Peacekeepers known as the Augmented Division. The blind are given augmentations to see, in Infrared, UV, radio waves, Noospheric frequencies, or even gravity waves. Those who once were lame are made to walk, sometimes customized with multiple legs, or other. When a sense is missing, the Galov will train them to become masters of what senses they have left. The deaf may become those sharp to sight. The blind may become sharp to sound.
For those not in the Augment program, the Galov insists they live a dignified and respected life. In the name of the Imago Dei, for in the Imago Dei they were made, in the Imago Dei they must be loved. The Galov only imposes two restrictions. They must respect their body as a temple, and respect their augments, as much as a part of themselves.
"The boundary between neurotypicals and neurodiversials is largely just a formality. All participate in the great orthogonality of man. Is the neurodiversial lesser for they are different? No. We are resilient, *because* we are different. What no machine may map, what no man may plan, what no xeno can anticipate, in the ever divergencing paths of man, we become untraceable. In untraceability, we become invincible. Is the neurotypical lesser, for being normal, or generic? No. Is the person with interests in anthropology, biology, stamp collecting, and model trains. Who are warm, cold, hot, wild, mild, expressive, withdrawn. Who come from cultures spanning stars, jungles, habitats, climates from the depths of the ocean to the vacuum of space. Are they just one category of being? No, these are just as diverse and different as those who are neurodiversal are. All are participants in the great orthogonality of man."

The Monohumans:
For one reason or another, every group in the galaxy has come up with the same idea. To create a branch of human that was specifically good at one thing. A disposable, single-purpose tool. Whether it was a human only made to fight, give musical performances, work, or otherwise. They were engineered, lived short lives, fulfilled their only purpose, and quickly withered and died.
The very existence of the Monohumans is an abhorrant abomination to the Galov. Who insist it violates human dignity, and specifically the Plurality of humankind. As such, monohumans are relentlessly hunted down by the Peacekeepers, their creators persecuted to the highest level of Galov law, and the monohumans themselves sent to be modified, to restore their plurality.
The opinion among the Monohumans themselves is mixed. Some wish to be granted plurality, one of the quinessential aspects of the human condition. Others believe this is an infringement on their calling, their destiny. They want to be mono, they want to burn bright and disappear. They want to be the best there ever was.
Examples:
-The Neon Houses literally grow an entire race of idols. Who are born age 14, and die by their 11th birthday, when they turn physically 25. To be endlessly used and recycled as a cash grab. This is a horrifying abomination to the Galov, who do everything they can to get it shut down, but the Neon Houses have a lot of money. And while money isn't going to stop a Galov battleship from levelling your corporate headquarters, as well as the planet it's on. The Galov isn't exactly going to crack open a world for something like this. So it goes slowly. In the courts.

Plurality Mandate:
"Instead of a fixed purpose, like the animals of Eden, God instead gave humanity free will. The greatest of all gifts."
The Galov defines human plurality as the multiplicity of mankind. That all humans are defined in part by their plurality, that while they may be good at music, combat, or any number of other skills, they they have the possibility to do more. They believe this pluralism is a inherent part of the Imago Dei, that all men, should have the choice to choose what they become, not have it assigned to them at birth by genetics.
Those who notice the Plurality mandate often accuse the Galov of hypocrisy. You hypocrite, did you not create the Transhumans, and the Orhumans for this very purpose? And while they will get defensive, the Galov will counter with two main facts. One, the transhumans were the tribes, not them. But second, that just because the transhumans were made for a single environment does not make them less plural. They feel, they love, they make art and sing great songs. They create, they build. Same with the Orhumans. No matter what purpose they were made to do, and what environment they were made for. They are capable of more than just their job. They are human, at least in some sense. They are categorically different from the monohumans.

The Orhumans (Orthogonal Humans)
"Diversity is not a defect. They are a tool, and a weapon. Diversity and complexity, both ways we glorify our creator. Let us cultivate the garden which they grow, let Darwinism dictate the ones which survive, and let the two Iron Principles dictate the weeds we prune."
The Orhumans are effectively specialized creations and hencemen of the Galactic Government. Where transhumans are made for settling worlds, Orhumans are made as tools of the Galactic Government, and for specific purposes. Orhumans don't really control many worlds, there is usually just the one where all of them are grown. Once they're born, employment is nearly guaranteed, and their life path with the Galactic Government is extremely stable. Despite this, many do desire life outside the guardrails, and many do end up "going rogue", and joining up with other cultures.
The reason the Galactic Government creates them is because the human psychological framework, like all frameworks contain blind spots. (Godel's Incompleteness Theorem) And the Orhumans are modified humans in order to help humanity spot these blindspots. Unlike the transhumans, the Orhumans are innately part of the upper class of the galactic bureaucracy, and thus enjoy a much higher status. The Galactic Government also tends to have a stronger view of human dignity, and take great effort to ensure Orhumans live dignified lives.
Half this stuff is, super classified. Because as it turns out, the Galactic Government is running an SCP-Foundation level containment game, and this universe is far, far larger than what we can imagine.

-Derivaters (Those who split apart, understand, and mechanize to an extreme degree. Good at breaking down, and disassembling anything into its components. Bad at big picture.)
-Integraters (Those who string together narratives into an all-consuming whole. Good for "theory of everything" theories and forecasting dynamic feedback loops in advance. Bad at details.)
-Orthogonals (The most common type, just there to explore different viewpoints.) 
--Xenospeakers (Those who have their mental frequency made to communicate with xenos.)
---Angel Speakers (Those who communicate with the strange entities outside the universe.)
---Half-Shapers (Those who live among those who arise from the fabric of reality.)
--Chronomen (These experience time in non-consecutive order, and have knowledge about the future along with blindspots about the past.)
---The Spiral Man (He was created to see what humanity would be like in the future. To trace the Infinity Spiral and see where it ends. He developed a extreme phobia of humans, and began screaming anytime he looked in a mirror. It appeared he only gained a fear of humans. So long as he is wearing a certain uniform that masks his human form, he can almost be seen as sane again. The program was terminated.)
--Warpmen (Those made to specifically explore and understand the Noosphere.)
--Displacers (Those who have their sense of dimensional orientation horribly displaced. Can perceive dimensions other than our own and exist at a right angle to our own existence. Very few are created, as it is considered "cruel".)
---Dihumans (... Yikes, where the hell did they go? They clipped out of existence. Probably to some right angle version of reality. We live in a... Somewhere around the ballpark of a 100D universe, and there are many different ways you can be right angled to our own 3d existence. It has been proven that 3D is needed for life, meaning there is no 4D ultra-entity able to kill us.)
---Diwatchers (Just keep watching the right angles to make sure there's no threat to us.)
---Diclippers (Those who retain their sanity and human form and can "clip" into these right angle realities.)
--Soulers (Those who can jump from body to body. They never "die" but are instead able to endlessly reincarnate by re-possessing fresh bodies. Where humans are a soul-body hybrid, Soulers are a soul that happens to have a body.)
--Fractaloids (Those who can zoom into infinite detail and intuitively understand the fractal nature of the hypermicro.)
--Aleph Null (The organization for intuiting extra-dimensional threats.)
---Ordered Spacers (Those who colonize nearby Ordered Spaces. Think transhumans, who are made for a specific planet, but for parallel universes. Not at right angles, just really, really far away in different universe-bubbles.)
-Althumans (Less about esoteric utility, more about experimentation.)
--Dreamspeakers (Those who speak with images rather than words.)
--One-Minders (Those who think like one collective consciousness with no individualism. This is evolutionarily screwy, but the Galov (Galactic Government) keeps them around for alternative perspectives.)

Discoveries of the Galactic Government:

Humans are mini universes. That is what a soul is, a mini-universe compressed into a body. The imagination engages in creation every time they engage in thought. The exact "volume" of these mini universes is not entirely known, but is estimated to be around moon or planet sized. The life one lives and the creations and the dreams they envision get carved into their "mindscape".

One's mindscape is developed as they create more and more. Some mindscapes remain largely undeveloped, and their remaining creative energy is passed on to the next generation. But rarely, one will get a rich, internally developed world. In what is known as "complete" universes. The connections one makes creates a bridge between these worlds, bits and pieces of their worlds end up in one another. When a person dies, the creative energy gets recycled back into the Noosphere, freed up to make new worlds, though these worlds still survive in some form.

When two people are in love, they can create a shared universe between them, and it is suspected this is how new souls and new mini-universes are created. A floating displacer was suspended in a low-gravity environment at a right angle to normal reality. Due to his condition, he was regularly lonely and unable to properly interact with other humans, communicating primarily through intercoms. But he dreamed, oh man how he dreamed.

One of the researchers studying him was a writer on the side. They communicated a lot, and she said that she had never met someone as creative and as understanding as he was. Their longest chat lasted a consecutive 36 hours. One day, she vanished, and so did he. They found out that she had called in some favors from her colleagues, and turned herself into a displacer as well.

And where the displacer was once suspended, was a vast, new mini-universe.

What the Spiral Man Saw:

Humanity in this setting is meant to be a species without limitations, one which can grow exponentially indefinitely. All the horrid cosmic horrors that are depicted as the predators or superiors of mankind in this setting were revealed to be eventually eclipsed by the even more horrifying final form of humanity. Humanity is the singularity and the end of everything. The Spiral Man saw the true soul of mankind, saw the infinite, spiralling longing, and in it saw the end of everything.

Not the universe-everything, not the multiverse-everything. Everything-everything, on a level so extreme it would paralyze even eldritch terrors if they knew what they were fighting. Even the current, galaxy spanning form is but an embryo compared to what was to come. Something that would consume all creation and destroy it. He saw the monster humanity not only would become, but always was. And seeing just how dark the road humanity would lead all creation down, in the pursuit of trying to fill with conquest what was lacking within their hearts, caused his sanity to completely shatter. He witnessed it, the final war of all there was. And he felt like an ant on a planet that was being torn asunder, the surface fracturing as the world erupted.

This is why the Spiral Man screams when he sees humans.

The Galov, after this actually had a serious ethical discussion about the ramification of the Spiral Man's discoveries. It had already been known that in accordance to "Spiral Theory", humanity was already an infinite being of sorts. Human souls have the "Imago Dei", perfect mappings onto the axioms of the universe that let them to intuit the higher creative structures of creation. (This has been used by many religions to justify a creation myth.) It was already nearly proven mathematical certainty that intelligent life, whether human or non human (aliens, posthumans, AI) was now destined to subsume all creation. This was more just confirmation it would be humans that did it.

At least some suggested the idea of wiping out humanity, about destroying the human race to preserve creation, but this idea was voted down, if only because "What's the point of preserving a universe no one can experience"? And they weren't "nice" enough to destroy their own race to let some other race experience it. The knowledge that humanity was destined to take the stars and beyond eventually spread across the galaxy, though without experiencing exactly what the Spiral Man had seen, it was hard to see why exactly he had gone insane.

Spiral Theory:
- Strength of all known natural calamities < N.
- Endurance of known spacefaring civilizations >>> N. Call these "strong civilizations".
- Therefore, a strong civilization cannot go extinct from a natural calamity.
- Therefore, if a strong civilization goes extinct, it can only be at the hands of a stronger civilization.
- Some strong civilizations are non-limiting/exponentially growing at rate R > 1. These are Spiral Civilizations.
- R^t (lim t -> infinity) = Infinity. Where t is time.
- Spiral Civilizations continuously spawn. Probability of spiral civilization defeating another civilization > 0.
- Therefore, with no inhibitions, a spiral civilization will eventually take over everything.
- The race to become the final infinite civilization is called "the Spiral Race".
- All civilizations that do not participate in the Spiral Race will eventually be destroyed by, or be dependent on the civilizations that do.

"False N" objection.
- "False N" theorists believe there may be a much, much larger N out there not yet discovered. This is known as the "False N Spiral Hypothesis".

"Quietist" argument.
- "Quietists" believe a rate of R <= 1 may be more sustainable.
- Counter-argument against the Quietists: If R1 <= 1, R2 > 1. Then (lim t-> Infinity) AR1^t < BR2^t for all A,B.

False N Spiral Hypothesis is popular. And the response is normally the following:
- Even for some extremely large N. For all R>1, R^t > N for some value of t. It's a matter of catchup.

Though Spiral Theory dictates there will be a winner, it doesn't specify which or what winner.
- Unitarists believe there can only be one victor of the spiral race. And that the optimal strategy is unitary.
- Pluralists argue the final infinity could be a coalition or a group of beings. And that the optimal strategy is pluralistic.

All Spiral Theorists fall on a spectrum from unitary to pluralist. The current position of the Galov (the GALactic gOVernment) leans heavily towards pluralism.

Galov: The destination is inevitable. But we believe it to be worthwhile to ensure the rise is done in a Humane, dignified way.
This is the incentive to continue fighting. Spiral theory only predicts a future civilization will eventually take over everything. It doesn't say if what that civilization looks like, if it's one, or many. This is something worth fighting for.

The Spiral Mandate:
For most humans, they don't know that it's going to be humanity who takes charge. They just know it to be one of any number of sophontic beings. But through Spiral Theory, they have almost mathematical certainty that *some* sophontic civilization will eventually take over everything. This is effectively Manifest Destiny, a desire to see the universe reshaped to their image, whether it be their particular group, humanity as a whole, or humanity alongside a coalition of other sophonts.

Humanity is already a known value. R ~= 1.02-1.03 per year. Mankind is already in the arena. Other competitors exist, some faster, some slower. Many will be annihilated by Thucydide's Trap by higher civilization. Others are "false spirals", which seem spiral-inclined for now, but have a natural upper plateau. What is certain is the race for the Spiral Race has already begun.

Xenos:
Alien species whose biological origin cannot be traced back to Earth.

The Two Occupations:

The Meta-Men:
Mankind's First Contact.

It was a momentous day when the Meta-Man first made contact with humanity. A singular, floating organism in low Earth orbit. Mankind had long suspected of other lifeforms. But up until now, there was no reason to believe they would be hostile. Humanity, excited to make first contact, broadcast messages of welcoming, cooperation, and coexistence. The Meta-Man, in return launched an all out attack, and the First Metan War had began.
The Meta Man had more durability than cities, and greater strength than hydrogen bombs. Simply put, he was a one man army. The war lasted some 7 days, much of humanity's cities were leveled to the ground. But when humanity refused to submit, the Meta-Man was eventually worn down through sheer attrition. The Meta Man had been incredibly weakened by days of non-stop fighting, the extreme fatigue hindered its regenerative abilities. It had taken a lot of damage just from the sheer amount of Newtonian force and artillery shells humanity had thrown at it. The final straw was getting him to be weakened enough, luring him to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, and detonating as many hydrogen bombs as they could. Humanity by this point was bleeding, with hundreds of millions dead, but very much still intact.
The Meta-Man race consisted only of a few million individuals, as it had recovered from something they called the "Dysgenic Overpopulation Collapse" event, which was the reasoning behind their extremely high quality, low quantity structure. And had specialized into a tiny remaining group of extremely high quality extraordinarily strong fighters, sometimes known as "superorganisms". Just one of these superorganisms was expected to hold down an entire planet.
They eventually learned that the Meta-Men were an extremely feared race on the other side of the galaxy. The fact Earth had survived one was no small feat. Humanity had learned later that due to the Meta-Men's own Darwinistic philosophy, they saw humanity as "honorable winners". And that Earth was both too far and too cumbersome for them to enforce their claim over, that the one soldier who was sent over was a straggler who had wandered unusually far.

The Metamen Empire:
Unlike most empires, the Metamen were genuinely mostly one unified empire, save some stragglers on the margins, and various rebel factions. With a population in the low millions, governance was relatively straight forward, if difficult due to the life year distances. Most of their military force is spent keeping each other in line, not occupied planets, which they use for resources.

Roasians:
Mankind's First Occupation.

An early stellar empire that first unified a few star systems under a unified polity known as the "Empire of the World" (Yanna er-ors Roas), and which used primitive jump gates before the invention of more sophisticated Newton drives. But at the time, even this empire had monumentally more powerful tech than humanity, which had over a century to recover from the attack of the Meta Man, and spread across the Solar System. The Roasians were based out of Rho Coronoe Borealis, a much more nearby star system than the Meta Men.
Roas had first marked Earth down for expansion back during the Medieval Ages, but now that a thousand years had passed, were alarmed to find that humanity had now advanced into the late spacefaring stage. What was once thought to be an easy conquest of a backwater was now elevated to the desired intact capture of what could be the 2nd most valuable world of their empire, second only to Roas itself. The surprise of humanity being a spacefaring civilization resulted in the destruction of Roas's first Terran jump gate, a monumental loss in Roasian resources, and gave humanity a 50 year time window before a second jump gate opened up around Makemake.
The First Solar War saw humanity fight an existential war of survival as Roasians closed in on the Inner Solar System. But Roas was not here for extermination. They were here for conquest. Earth was too valuable, and was integrated into the Roasian Empire, the crown jewel of the Roasian Empire. Problem was, this jewel ended up an eternal headache for the Roasians, even more so after the Meccan Massacre, which turned a fifth of Earth's population against Roas in a permanent fatwa.
Roas was demographically declining, and was conquering other worlds as a way to prop up its dying empire. The Imperial Core of Roas had strip mined its Periphery for people and resources, its native population of the imperial core having been destroyed by mass immigration from the Periphery, people who only worked, and made to forget their own cultures to serve a parasitic ruling class. They had drained other worlds of their wealth before, Earth was a last ditch attempt to keep Roas on life support. Earth was dynamic, Roas was dying. As it turns out, Earth's dynamism came from constant competition, Roas's unity bred complacency. A thousand year old empire had stagnated and fossilized.
When the Empire fell, Earth rebelled, and cast off its chains in a worldwide revolution. Terran culture eventually took over, mixed with, and was exported to Roas, breathing life into an old world.
This was the last time Earth was ever held in xeno hands.

Roasian Geneaology:
-Ors Roas ("The World". Home world of the Roasians.)
--Imperial Core
---Core Elites (In charge, cannibalizing everything around them to keep themselves afloat.)
---Core Natives (Now extinct, demographically replaced by hostile elite scheme. (It was believed the immigrants would resist less.))
---Core Imports/Forgetters (From the Periphery, have been intentionally stripped of their culture.)
--Imperial Periphery
---Periphery Cultures (Demographically collapsing from despair, all their people have been shipped to the Core.)
---Roasian Fertility Zones (Roasian people farms, last ditch attempt to save the Roasian race. Undergoing psychological collapse. People don't take well to being cattle forever, at some point they snap.)

Before the dawn of the Empire of the World, the Core had a fossilized, though sophisticated culture, and the Periphery was a hotbed of new cultural expression and experimentation. The Core was destroyed to make room for the new immigrants, and the Periphery's cultural experiment was disrupted before it could reach its conclusion. Since the fall of the Empire of the World, the Periphery has managed to recover, and resume its cultural development, leading to a kind of cultural revival, though one born very, very late.

As of the contemporary Galactic Era, the Roasians have become an "allied people" subsumed within the Human Empire. The Galov keeps a close eye on them, not for humanity's sake, but their own. The surviving Periphery cultures had been extremely damaged, both psychologically and genetically by the imposition of the Fertility Zones. Drastic genetic intervention was needed to prevent the genetic collapse of the species. As a result, the modern Roasians living under Galov oversight are sometimes known as the Neo-Roasians.

Xenospecies:
Non Earth-originated life, or "xenos" is common across the galaxy. Life in the galaxy is fairly common, there are literal millions of worlds with alien life within human space (Though mostly bacterial). And there are hundreds, or thousands of specific xenosophonts (xenos with sophontic properties), in human space. They vary from primitive, to medieval, even to early space age, before being subsumed by the larger Human expansions. Under Galov decree, xenosophonts are entitled to similar rights as human beings, under a similar justification of the Imago Dei. (With this being understood as intelligence, their intelligence is seen as proof of God's mandate to treat them with dignity.) However, with human dignity already being hard to enforce, and xeno dignity often being a second priority, many xenosophonts end up being mistreated across the galaxy, with Peacekeeper intervention often necessary in the worst cases.

The full of list of xenos, much like the individual list of human nations is too much to count. So here are some of the most notable or major.

Xenosophonts:
Due to a quirk in convergent evolution, many intelligent species resolved their evolutionary issues the same way humans did. Free Riders, natural self interest, natural selection ended up creating decentralized, coordinated systems with complex systems of incentive and punishment. In other words, they created civilizations, culture, and laws. Due to their similarity to humans, Imago Dei is enforced to a much stricter degree with them compared to xenoexotics. Though due to the Galov's limited resources, this tends to slip through the cracks, with even human dignity not being a fixed problem, xeno dignity is further down the priority list. And heavy mistreatment is not uncommon.
Xenosophonts often join the Galov Peacekeeping force, specifically in the Xeno Corps, as they know the Galov is far more likely to treat them humanely, due to their iron belief in Imago Dei. However, many are blocked or hindered by local governors, who have a vested interest in keeping them where they are.

Integrated Xenosophonts:
Various races such as the Roasians have now been integrated into the greater Human expansion project. Serving as "cooperative races" with roughly equivalent rights, though actual enforcement is strained. These Xenosophonts tend to be of spacefaring age or later, and can span up to a few star systems and have local autonomy. Though due to the extremely decentralized nature of the galaxy, local nations mistreating their enclosed xenosophonts is not uncommon. Xenosophonts of earlier than spacefaring age tend to be put under the umbrella of observatory zones instead.

Xenosophont Observatory Zones:
The single most valuable resources in a voluntary scarcity society (as opposed to post-scarcity) is orthogonal ideas. Though the Galactic Government (Galov) maintains a large pool of Orthogonal Humans (Orhumans) as well as cooperation with allied Xenosophonts to cover the vast blind spots in human psychology, there is no substitute for the real deal. These observatory zones are kept under extensive surveillence and human contact is extremely isolated, as any level of human interaction could seriously alter their natural orthogonal development, and rob humanity of wonderfully orthogonal ideas.
As of late, the Galov has begun creating artificial xenosophonts in order to set on orthogonal paths, but the imagination of human minds cannot match the chaotic infinite creativity of the cosmos, and as a result, there is no true substitute for the real deal, only "close enough" imitations to supplement it.

Qsimu:
An diamond-hard set of systems located during humanity's rapid expansion. Consisting of 6 systems forming an octahedron. A massive fleet of nanoswarms defend the entire system. The amount of fleet power needed in order to clear out the nanoswarms is estimated to be massive, but doable. The energy output of the Qsimu systems are enormous, and it is estimated that the Qsimu have technological advantage over humans. Analysis of the Qsimu materials reveal their age to be millions of years old. Psychic scans of the Qsimu region find a level of extreme psychic density, implying a Qualia and sensory experience far higher than that of normal human operation.
It didn't take a genius to realize this was a Matrioshka brain, of a society that developed inwardly rather than outwardly. This is the first known instance of a "Quietist" civilization discovered in the wild, of a massive digital simulation made to cater to the hedonic needs and wants of billions of souls, distributed across 6 Dyson Swarm systems. Due to the sheer psychic density of the experience, plugging your brain into the Qsimu would give you a sense of "hyperreality", in that the Qsimu simulation would feel more real and intense than outside reality, and that outside reality would actually begin feeling fictional. Though this is an artifact of the subjective feeling of "reality", as opposed to any metaphysical claim about the Qsimu simulation.
Despite being clearly older and more advanced than humanity, humanity already has the fleet power to, at least theoretically, overwhelm and destroy the Qsimu systems. The Qsimu are Quietists who have chosen to lose the Spiral Race. And their future existence is contingent on the continued protection, or at least indifference of the human race. The Galov has put the entire region under their juristiction for scientific research, but also quarantine reasons.

Heleean Scieocracy:
Heleean Scien-Theocracy was one of the more influential influences on late Galov-era Christianity, but also cross-species anthropology after first contact. The Scieocracy was founded by a legendary founder who came to the Helee home planet a long time ago, taught them empiricism and rationalism shortly before their Industrial Revolution. The founder disappeared before stating that he needed to "tend to those who are not of this flock". The Founder was also a prolific healer, conjuring medicines that are still used by the Heleeans today, but his main focus was ethics. He railed against the slavery of his day, inverted the traditional Heleean hierarchy, and prompted multiple egalitarian movements that brought forth a steady string of reforms. (The Founder explicitly condemned revolutions, saying he was here to transform hearts, not transform governments.)
The Founderist Church became the overseer of all scientific advancement, and to this day the Scieocracy's science is heavily tied to the institution of Founderism, with most counter-Founder religious movements either being traditionalist or primitivist. It was not long at all before Christian missionaries, upon hearing this, began to speculate whether their Founder was Christ (or at least a Christian angelic prophet) in a different form. Also known as the "Multiple World Christ Hypothesis" (As in, Christ visited multiple worlds.) More importantly, the Heleeans never indicated their own Founder died on a cross for their sins, so the sanctity of the incarnation was considered unique.
The immense power of the Christian church across the Human Empire was eventually able to incorporate the Heleean Church back into the fold, similar to how Nestorian churches in China were slowly converted. The Scieocracy's most lasting legacy was that Scieocratic ideas began becoming extremely popular across the human empire. Specifically, the idea of science, rationalism, empiricism, and humanism being "delayed revelations" planted by Christ, but later realized by his church.
A few decades after the integration of the Heleean church, the Moralintern Ecumenical Council officially recognized the doctrine of the "Infinity Spiral" as part of the acceptable Christian canon (Though one which could be denied by its denominational members). An accelerationist vision that God's intention was for humanity (and the rest of intelligent creation) to technologically accelerate, and hold dominion over the stars.

Central Empire (Meta-Man Empire):
The Central Empire is mildly amused that the world they attacked a few hundred years ago is now spreading into its own empire, though they still treat Earth as a curiosity. Though mankind now covers a billion worlds, they're still a regional player on the galactic stage. No one is quite sure how extensive the Central Empire is, only that it has at most a few million members. They haven't mobilized their heavy hitters yet, and it's widely speculated that the Meta-Man that was defeated by Earth during First Contact was likely among their weakest members. It's suspected the Meta Men have a strongly Pareto Principle'd ratio of power, with the strongest individual Meta Man probably being extraordinarily strong. Though there are more and more Meta-Men agents showing up in human space. Seemingly assessing their strength.
Humanity is probably aware that the Central Empire, as expansive and of unknown power as it may be, is probably the only real threat to humanity's astropolitical existence at the moment. It's heavily debated whether their disinterest in human affairs is due to sheer power difference, or because of overconfidence and arrogance. Humanity has been building up their own answer to the Meta Men, known as the "Star Fighters", hoping to replicate their extremely high quality of fighter. Unlike the Orthogonal xenos, Meta Men are remarkably human like.

Subservient Races:
The Meta-Men maintain a massive collection of "subserviant races". Who the Meta-Men have uplifted and brought to dominance. If the Metamen are the quality over quantity, these races provide the average foot soldier, the grunt work, providing numbers where the Meta-Men lack numbers. As there are less than 10 million Meta Men, with each one holding down around 10 worlds, the Central Empire is holding down about 100 million worlds. The Meta-Man is a leader, and that world's protector, but they also have governments and bureaucracies made up of the subservients under them, with the Meta-Man acting as an absolute monarch, though even he is liable to the Central Imperial Court, and can face punishment for their crimes.
Despite this clear subserviant position, most subserviant races are somewhat grateful for the Meta-Men. The Meta-Men's Darwinistic philosophy demands that they take on greater hardships than their subjects, that they do all the fighting, and provide a majority of the planet's protection. Though the subserviants are subjects, they are subjects to be protected. They are utilitarianly useful for the Empire, and it is the responsibility of the Meta-Man in charge to keep them in line, but also to keep them fed, productive, and alive.
Some of these subserviants have even trained to the degree where they can become Meta-Men fighters in their own right, though this is extraordinarily rare.

Star Fighters:

Humans augmented to the peak of human physique, harnessing the power of willpower in order to physically enhance themselves and break through what was once thought to be human barriers. They possess the ability to engage in telekinesis, able to move around objects far beyond their normal means, harden their own bodies (an ability that scales depending on level of willpower), and mentally overwhelm others through sheer willpower. They are extremely hardened, normally trained in a Spartan like manner, for years. Star Fighters do have some limitations, for one they must consume far, far more than a normal human, they must follow the laws of thermodynamics, though some gain the ability to flip small amounts of matter into antimatter, giving them a ridiculously high metabolism and energy extraction rate.

Human Martial Combat Techniques:

Kinetic Psychicism:
Psychicism is a real phenomenon, which is best expressed as harnessing the "psychic force", a fundamental force of nature that can be manipulated with the mind. The psychic force is powered by human metabolism, meaning it is tied to your diet, and is not infinite. Combat psychics normally need to eat specialized, high calory diets, or at the highest levels, develop the ability to flip matter into antimatter, turning their body into an antimatter reactor (normally nanograms at a time), giving them the energy they need. The heat energy is normally converted to more metabolic energy, though over time, psychics do risk overheating.
The effort needed to flip matter into antimatter, or vice versa, is an intensely mentally taxing task, and requires concentration. One has a finite amount of psychic energy tied to the amount of metabolic energy stored in your body. You can absolutely pour out more psychic energy through sheer willpower, but this also increases the flow of psychic energy, potentially draining your metabolic resources faster.

This is different from Social Psychicism, which is better understood as having access to the Noospheric vault of memories, as well as being able to translate thoughts.

Psychic Hardening:
As it turns out, willpower/psychic strength is a fundamental force of nature that can bond atoms as well as anything else. The act of using your own extreme psychic ability to harden a set of atoms, either your own, or that of an object you are holding, is known as "psychic hardening". And is the primary way humans have been able to increase their durability, leading to the phenomenon of the strongest known material known to the Galov is any material given sufficient psychic hardening by a top-tier psychic. "Psychic hardening" can be imparted onto normal materials, but will naturally fade away without routine replenishment. The psychic force travels through force carriers, much like regular fundamental forces.
It should be noted that psychics are unable to impart psychic hardening as they sleep, making it that no matter how strong a psychic a person may be, they are ultimately still human and vulnerable.
Also of note, psychic hardening is why most ships are manned. Periodic crews of psychics can harden the hull of the ship. Drones, or autonomous systems have their place, but are massively fragile in comparison. As well, psychic hardening is a multiplier, it's not an excuse to build your ship out of styrofoam, as psychicism only enhances what is there. You still want high quality metal, if only so your ship doesn't implode the second one person forgot his shift.
Hardening can also be used to overcome g-forces, mostly just by physically holding all your atoms in place. It is extremely painful, but you can do it.

Matter Trawlers:
Especially among those who lived near, or among the Matter Singers, some humans have managed to replicate some level of matter singing, or "trawling". Effectively harnessing diffuse material from the Matter Singer's "trawlspace". As the amount of material available is fundamentally dependent on gathering new material from new spaces (trawlspace has a one to one correspondance to realspace), "trawl-based" combat techniques, where one must frequently summon new weapons from trawlspace must fundamentally rely on speed. More speed/velocity = faster trawl rate = ability to craft more weapons. As a result, matter trawlers favor an extremely high velocity, high movement amount of combat.

The attempt to mechanize psychicism:
Ever since psychicism has been discovered as a fundamental force, the Galov, and several private corporations have been trying to utilize it as a new mechanizable force. If psychicism can be extracted from humans, can't we industrialize it, or farm it? Imagine the good we can do if psychicism could be mass produced.
One problem with that. Psychicism is derived from the emergent properties of cognitive complexity, as well as the cognitive complexity of their experiences. To create psychic forces, in other words. You need a mind, and not just a mind, a level of complexity in their experiences. Okay, that's fine, we'll just simulate a brain then, maybe tune up the time dilation to 100. Problem is, that a simple mind produces extremely little psychic force, you need to create a complex mind, and specifically high level, human-like intelligence. Okay, that's also fine, Galovian attempts have been made to spin up miniature universes, or simulations in order to power psychicism.
The problem with that human-level intelligence intentionally wants to escape. And the amount of psychic power you can draw from it scales up the more clever, orthogonal (multi-dimensional in thinking), and complex you make it. The more power you can extract from it, the more it can think of ways to break the system and exploit it. It just becomes a massive, never-ending cat and mouse containment problem. Every attempt to "mechanize" or industrialize psychicism has resulted in catastrophic containment failure.
The most efficient option still continues to be just to enlist volunteering humans who are willing to follow orders, out of their own free will.

Psychicism, Technology, Industrialism:
Despite all this, neither psychicism, technology, nor industrialism holds an advantage. A specialized techno-weapon can be made to take down a psychic, a skilled enough psychic can find a way to bypass most weapons. A good battleship can hold off a psychic and even kill them, but a skilled psychic can also cleave a battleship in two. Good logistics can starve out an army of psychics, making them weak and vulnerable. Even a regular human can kill a god-tier psychic with ambush, stealth, and a basic pistol. Just as they can assassinate a CEO of a factory, or a battleship pilot, once they have left the battleship.
After all, even the best psychics have to sleep. And why even the strongest psychics needed to make friends, and watch their backs. This is why sleep was never abolished by humanity, it forced social cooperation, and abolishing it led to a breakdown in trust, due to the lack of vulnerability. Societies that abolished it usually quickly fell apart, and it was deemed not worth the hassle.

The Galactic Olympics, and Planetary Deathmatches:
One of the few events that actually do hold the galaxy together somewhat, the Galov contacts all worlds once every 4 years to send over their best athletes in a variety of sports, where they compete in the Galactic Olympics. The strongest of the strong are gathered together to engage in a celebration of strength and meritocracy. There are a few categories, baselines, effectively a "special Olympics" for humans without augmentations, and then the general category, where all things are allowed. And events can span entire star systems, testing their sheer will of power. Between psychicism, technology, augmentation, all is allowed. Those who win aren't compensated with wealth (As most worlds are only voluntarily under scarcity anyway), so instead the Galov promises the world glory, becoming known to a galaxy with 20 billion worlds. Attention is now a more scarce resource than money, and puts them forever in the public consciousness, or at least as a footnote in a galactic textbook
Less supervised by the Galov, every planet eventually gets the idea to pit their best fighters against each other, strong psychics, Star Fighters, or mad men with extremely powerful technological advancements and place them in an MMA-style arena. The Galov is well known to send agents to attend these events, scouting out future recruits for the Peacekeepers, the Galov Agents, or the Star Fighters. Often ready to drop lucrative contracts at the drop of a hat.

Arsenal of the Galov Agents:
Your typical Galov agent will have use any number of psychicism, matter trawling, antimatter flipping, or regular specialized technology. Agents can be a jack of all trades or specialize in one or two. Some agents are extremely potent psychics, others are "anti-matter wielders" who enjoy blowing things up. Others will be augmented with extremely advanced technology, others still are just mad scientist types who enjoy kit-bashing their own arsenal together and wielding it as they wish. In general, the agent has much freedom to choose the combat doctrine they like, as they are mostly lone agents.
Heck, the agents aren't even solely limited to physical warfare. There are at least a few agents whose main superpower is just forming connections. They come onto your world, wait for a few months, and suddenly they have organized a full blown coup and planet-scale rebellion. They have no special power, but they can motivate other people into fighting.

Arsenal of the Galactic Peacekeepers:
Your average Galactic Peacekeeper grunt, despite being much of disposable cannon fodder, are still treated with a level of respect, and given the best mass produced gear the Galov can manage. Their standard weapon is the standard lightgun. Roughly with the same firepower as your standard assault rifle. Humanity began making the transition from slugs and metal ammo to hard light ammo, as the distances involved for combat became larger and larger. Standard assault rifles are still used for closer range combat, especially on planetary surfaces. Light guns are loaded with pellets of hard light, carefully manufactured so when melted, they will release all their light energy in one direction, effectively acting as a "frozen laser".
Heavier lightguns are known to pack the same rough power as an artillery blast, though normal artillery is also used, especially in planetary settings where the shockwave of an explosion is more effective than in the vacuum of space. As well, every Galactic Peacekeeper is equipped with a standard issue VR helmet, with an appended AI companion that helps mark out targets, locate and alert them about incoming threats, and allow them to toggle between night vision, infrared, normal vision, and various other EM spectrums. And also replay events in order to track down threats.
The traditional uniform of the Peacekeeper is all white. Camouflague is used in terrestrial environments, but in space "there is no such thing as camouflague".

The Galov Agent Worship Problem:
One of the issues of the Galov making first contact with many alien species, landing human agents who are capable of eradicating disease, purifying water, and producing fantastical technologies. Who literally come on rocket ships from the sky, and may have psychic powers or tech that can level mountains is that less developed xenosophonts, or heck, even advanced xenosophonts have the tendency to worship them as a god. There was a fairly developed late information age xenosophont species that Galov agents landed on, where one guy requested to meet with the local government, but also cured enough diseases and gave out enough help on the way that a fully industrialized late information age society began forming cults of worship around them.
It only gets worse with more primitive species. Entire tribes of less developed societies have actually mistaken the humansa s their gods. And to be fair, it's hard to blame them when they cure plagues, solve famines, and come down in literal fire chariots of gold and silver. Much less than try and avoid contact, the Unifaiths of the Galov have begun leaning into the god angle. But instead calling themselves "ambassadors to God".
Essentially, they take advantage of the messianic complex and then use their reverence from the population to deflect it towards their own vision of the divine. "We are strong, but we are not gods! We are emissaries of an even greater power, if you fear us with our own power, imagine how great the power of our God is. We are not spiritual superiors, we are spiritual equals, and God wants you to know that he loves you as well."
Pretty effective sales pitch.

Spacetime Manipulation Sword: (Shock Blades)
"I am going to revive swords in martial combat even if it f---ing kills me!" -Words of the author of the first spacetime manipulation sword shortly before uploading the first schematic to the Standardized Invention Database.
This should not be happening. Swords by all means should be obsolete weapons. But the sword has one advantage over the gun that no human, no government, no even law of physics can erase. Swords are f---ing cool, and the insane species we know as humanity would rather die than give up trying to resurrect it.
Some basement dweller fueled by nothing but knight and samurai movies and a desire to make swords practical again or die trying in the age of galactic combat created one of the most obscenely bizarre weapons in galactic history, the shock blade. How shock blades (or, just swords) work is that the edge is actually a specialized space folder, which creates a shockwave of "creased" space that tears people apart through spacetime distortions, simulating the clean cut of a blade. This "creasing" ability is amplified with power, and is activated when the sword is swung with the power enabled. This requires such a high amount of energy that an antimatter or hard light battery serves as the core of the sword handle.
This allows a single superhuman psychic agent, who is already obscenely overpowered in space, to simply take a space sword and literally slice a battleship in half at a range of several kilometers away. The disadvantages of the shock blades is still evident, you still need to be in visual range of the target, and in space 10 kilometers is still incredibly close range. The use of shock blades is usually paired with matter trawling, or other high mobility strategies that allow one to close to gap.
Of course, it was not long until a gun variant was made, known as the "shock gun", which basically shoots a "shotgun blast" of spacetime shockwaves, though this is a more rough rupture than the blade, which is more of a clean cut.

Matter Singers:
Through an unknown, potentially orthogonal method, matter singers have the capacity to "sing" into existence large chunks of matter from some kind of extracosmic source. Theories vary from being able to raise the "matter frequency" of Noospheric psychic material, until it becomes physical, extraction from right angled invisible realities, or some kind of pocket dimension. That is known is that the laws of thermodynamics obviously still apply, so clearly it's coming from somewhere. It's suspected this dimension, whatever it is, is also finite, making them also have a sense of scarcity.
Due to this, Matter Singers have no clear concept of manipulating objects. Items are first conceptualized in the head, before manufactured via singing. Their factories seem to be located at seemingly random locations, potentially located to tap into "resource deposits" in parallel universes. Unlike the Meta-Men, they are not limited to a few million individuals. They are an empire of at least 700,000 worlds, and have a great territory that rivals humanities.
They have what some have called a "magic system". The Galov strongly rejects this classification, instead calling it an "orthogonal physics system". "Singing" carries massive value in their culture, obviously. And the materials they have access to, as well as aesthetic or doctrinal preferences in what they make have created a culture roughly as diverse and strong as humanity. They are known as the "Great Pluralistic Rival".
There is no open state of war. Declaring war is nearly impossible in the current hyper-decentralized state of the galaxy. Much human-Singer trade, cooperation, and even alliances are made by individual nations, and the Singer equivalent to nations, sometimes translated as "collectives". But both sides seem to have a passive awareness that in some sense, they are rivals.
Singer collectives don't quite work the same way as human nations. They are biological in nature, and cannot be easily joined. It is closer to a much expanded biological family clan network than a typical human nation bound by ethnicity or idealism. The biological connections instinctively build trust. These collectives are signified by a biological marker. 
These collective ties can be severed forcefully, should a member be exiled from the group, where this biological marker can be forcibly altered by the patriarch (leader) of the collective. Or it can be severed by the individual, in which its marker will change randomly, effectively starting a new collective. These markers can only be transfered by biological lineage. Mating converts the submissive partner's marker to that of the dominant partner.
Somewhat disturbingly, this makes "rape conquests" an effective Darwinian strategy. In Singer society, sex is less of a showcase of affection or passion, and is more of a "initiation ritual", sometimes by force, into a collective. Due to this, Singers have a much looser view on sex and family structure. Normally, the dominant partner that transfers their marker to the submissive one is "male" (Used loosely here, basically just the individual that does not do childbearing, while "females" are those who do do childbearing), but in rare instances, it has been known to be female, leading to some matriarchal societies. This seems to be determined by a kind of aggressive mating ritual where one showcases their dominance over the other.
These markers can be changed with human technology, but early attempts at trying to disrupt the Matter Singer's society with marker disrupters has been noticed and counteracted by the Matter Singers, who now have more advanced ways to retain and remember each member as a member of the correct collective. In recent times, they appear to have moved to a kind of marker encryption, in which the markers have become much harder to forge and more complex.
In appearance, they loosely resemble squid like entities with extremely versatile tentacles. Singers tend to be tactile more than they are visual, meaning that much of their cultural differences is based on the materials they favor most, as well as sheer ergonomic feel. Their materials are hyper-exotic, as they seem to be "elevated" versions of extracosmic materials. They've historically been bad at baryonic chemistry, due to the ability to use singing as a crutch. They've gotten better at it, as they've traded with humans, but it's still a major lag-point.

Singer Matter:
The matter that matter singers "sing" into existence seems to be warped from a currently undiscovered/unexplained parallel universe. This matter does not interact with the strong nuclear force, nor the weak nuclear force, only interacting via electromagnetism and gravity. They have their own versions of the strong nuclear and weak nuclear force, sometimes called the or-strong or or-weak force, but these orthogonal equivalents do not interact with their normal counterparts.
The dimension they draw matter from is known as the "Singer Dimension" colloquially. And it seems to have a relatively diffuse matter distribution. Despite the fact that singer matter is affected by realspace gravity, the Singer Dimension seems to lack a gravitational field that would cause the matter to clump together. It's kind of more like a diffuse aether. Due to this, Singer manufacturies have to constantly be in motion in order to harvest singer matter, as each position in realspace also has correspondance to a location in the Singer dimension, and they can only "sing" matter into existence around the corresponding local area. This leads to the creation of "Matter Trawlers", which effectively skim through "unfished space" to harvest materials. And the creation of Moveforges, factories where it needs to be in constant motion (preferrably in planetary orbit, increasing trawl speed) to create things.
The depletion of singer material on their home planet created a rapid rush to develop airplanes, and later spaceflight technology.
It should be noted, Singers themselves are not made of Singer Matter. They're made of normal matter, but due to this crutch, their experience with normal baryonic matter is severely stunted.

Singer Ethics:
The primary problems the Singers had to solve was the problem of disloyalty, force VS cooperation, and free riders. Some Singers continue a centralized empire, with a massive group controlled downstream of a primordial patriarch/matriarch. Others have periodic splinterings, where a collective would routinely split every generation. The forced Darwinian nature of "mark-imprinting" led to much conflict, as even the leaders had to expend much energy keeping everyone in line, leading to "Consentarians" to rise, and eventually forbid the imprinting of marks against their will.
Later generations of "Assimilationists", who opposed the Consentarians would develop chemicals that would change the psychological makeup of those they mated with to ensure loyalty.

Due to the process of creation being "conceptualization -> summon -> refine", their creation myth generally goes a similar way, where they have a conceptual "pre-existence" before being created, and that they go back to the realm of pre-existence after they die. Generally speaking, it is just natural for them to first go with conceptualization before they go with creation. Even when it comes to non-physical things, such as a company, it's normal for them to map out how it works. In writing, they are ENTIRELY planners, not "pantsers". Trying to "wing" a project is just entirely alien to them.
Some say they draw matter from the pre-conceptual world, sometimes known as "Trawlspace", meaning that there is some level of reverence given to their created objects. Others just say it's not that big a deal, and treat it like an ordinary object.

Due to their like of speed, due to association with Trawl speed, Matter Singers seem to enjoy the feeling of acceleration.

Virtues in Singer Culture:
-Speed (Associated with Trawl Speed)
-Hardness/Stubbornness (Because hard things broke less frequently)
-Flexibility (Because flexible things broke less frequently, though they were sometimes useless.)
-Strength (Due to Dominance Mating Rituals, though also because they were subject to Darwinian evolution.)

Different Singer Organizational Types.:
As a massively pluralistic rival species, Singers are not a monolith.
-Assimilationists (Neo-Darwinism, the strong will subjugate the weak.)
--Scent Markers (Those who alter the behavior of those subordinate to them.)
---Fear Markers (Those who use fear to keep them in line.)
---Service Markers (Those who use a sense of service to the leader to keep them in line.)
---Idea Markers (Those who use a sense of greater good to keep them in line.)
----Idea Clades (This eventually led to loyalty to an idea rather than to a patriarch, and pure ideological states were born free of any one ruler.)
-----Free Clade (Maximal freedom)
-----Spiral Clade (Maximal Expansion)
-----Knower Clade (Maximal knowledge aquisition)
-----Materialist Clade (Maximal physical resource aquisition)
-----Networkers Clade (Just like meeting new people.)
-----Speed Riders (NOTHING ELSE MATTERS. WE MUST GO FASTER)
---The Lustful Ones (Those who used hormonal horniness to keep them in line.)
----Orgynics (A deeply uncomfortable group that has seemingly devolved into a mass orgy. Very very egalitarian! And hedonistic.)
--The Happy Ones (Those who use joy/euphoria to keep them in line.)
--The Hateful Ones (Those who use extreme violent hate of outsiders to keep them in line.)
-The Patriarchs (Patriarchs of massive collectives, each one with a different patriarch and a massive family line.)
--The Great Families (The individual big families)
--The Matriarchal Alliance (The matriarchs have to stay together to survive.)
-Consentarians (Those who are more voluntarily aligned. Believe in consent.)
--Voluntarists (Individualists who take consentarianism to a radical degree. Often work with humans.)
--The Lusantria Republic (Unironically convergently evolved into a democracy. Interesting.)

Each faction has it's own preferred tactile-visual culture. These include, but are not limited to:
-Metalic, Baroque, Braille, Black/Void (They just enjoy things as black as possible), and pretty much every combination of tacile+visual cues you can think of as long as it's not physically painful.
-The tactile culture also applies to ergonomics. You have right angle cultures, smooth cultures, etc. People often note that Singer stuff is very pleasant to hold, as it is the primary purpose of it. On a similar level, the Singers consider humans to be pretty good at art, and are surprised how aesthetically pleasing things are, at least with their poor vision.

You also have different groups being able to sing different materials. Generally speaking, there are two limits, their metabolism, which determines the energy they need to expend, and trawl speed. The faster they are moving, the stronger and more material they can summon.
-Metals (The utilitarian type, mostly used for crafting.)
--Firemetals (A smooth, black metal that is heavily heat resilient.)
--Stonetolls (A granite/marble like material.)
--Marblewood (A bright white/black that somehow feels of resin'd hardwood.)
--Rocktin (Stony tin.)
--Etc.
-Lights (They can just shoot lasers of various spectrums. Apparently hard light exists as a crystal in the Singer dimension, and almost instantly thaw into regular light within a few seconds of contact with this universe. These things will fire GAMMA RAYS at you if they want to. These are more geared for combat, but they're also used for etching things as well)

Music Sheets:
Perhaps no human invention has been more useful to the Matter Singers than the humble music sheet. In humanity's case, it was used for music. But it took on a whole new meaning for the Matter Singers, who found the whole system effectively perfect for their purposes, though they added a braille component to compliment their poor vision.
They now use human-derived music sheets as the backbone of their whole singing magic system, using them more than the humans ever could as de-facto singing instruction books, and these sheets effectively serving as spellbooks.

Whiteblocks:
-Closest Neurohuman Mapping: Autism 
-Black and white, rigid thinking.
-Really like equations and systematizing.
-Tend to see everything as a kind of utilitarian system.
-Not every system is math. Sometimes it's art, color balance, tonal balance, a bunch of other things. The main commonality is that they intuitively break things down into systems. Nothing just "is" except for the basic building blocks of everything.
-They're not cold, they're just dorks. Some of them literally run around with a utility function. They find it utterly bewildering that humans don't have their utility function memorized at the back of their head.
-No religion is complete without a 5 page addendum to the end where they give formal equations for many things. Entire schisms have been had whether the components to happiness is additive or multiplicative.
-Say the corniest possible emotional compliments to each other. Once again, they are not emotionless robots. They they instead say to their beloved significant other "you are the local maxima on my flourishing function" and the nearest human will need to fight the primal urge to give them a wedgie.
-They have a very clear divide of "people I don't care about" and "people I do care about". While they aren't going to let a stranger die, they don't particularly care about making them comfortable when they start talking.
-Some amount of hyperactivity and involuntary twitching.
-Sensitivity to certain stimuli, though this is different for each one. (To be fair, humans would be considered sensitive to stimuli, if you include being tickled. Humans just say "that doesn't count, that's normal!" Another one is high pitched noises, which humans hate but whiteblocks see as strange to be sensitive towards. Oh yeah, nails on chalkboard, scraping noises, and mosquito sounds. Instant way to cause a human meltdown.)

(Neurotypical) Human/Whiteblock conversation:
"Okay, you're not evil. You're just a bunch of weirdos."
"Well, so are you !"
"I- I am not!"
"Yeah you are, your species recoils at gentle touch and or grazing."
"That's called being ticklish! That's normal! Whatever, I'm going home and blasting music."
"Why?"
"It makes me happy"
"Define happy. Why does it make you happy? Why happy make you?"
"I- I don't know!? It just does!"
"Does it put you in sedation, excitement, or metaphysical contentment?"
"SOMETIMES THINGS JUST MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD, OKAY!?"

Pluriments: (Derived from Latin for "many minds")
-Closest Neurohuman Mapping: Multiple Personality/DID.
-Somehow, an xenosophontic race evolved multiple personalities in one brain.
-In all species, including humans, culture/religion is the layer that "compensates" for whatever quirks evolution forgot to clean up. (Altruism, manners, selflessness for humans.) In this case, a lot of culture is about trying to manage the fact they have multiple personalities in one brain.
-In modern contexts, especially with the rise of democracy in Pluriment society, "Parliamentarianism" is one of the dominant methods of doing so. Through "presidential" and "intraparty democracies" are also known.
-How it works for Pluriments is while they start off with one personality, they slowly pick up more as they encounter more situations, almost like how political parties are formed in response to specific events and actions. Generally speaking, more sheltered people have less personalities than ones which have experienced a lot.
-Most of their personalities were formed based on common situtaions they found themselves in and things going on in the background. Something about environment shaping the person.
-Pros: "Bad" personalities genuinely get weeded out, introspective, self improving, deliberately slow and methodical, more reflective than humans.
-Cons: Indecision, gridlock, really bad at making snap decisions. Unpredictability as every morning a new personality could surface, making it hard to build trust. "One party democracy" mental models sometimes solve this.
-Similar to adrenaline, they may have an emergency override option where they completely focus until the state of emergency has passed.
-Almost all of them will have some kind of color-coordinated ornament which helps others figure out who they're dealing with today. These can include headbands, bracelets, necklaces, etc. Modern iterations use LED lights and technology, but some prefer manually stringing together colorful beads, or just wearing a different rubber bracelet.
-There was originally a lot of tension because the Pluriments thought humans were all "mind-dictators" who were suppressing their other personalities. That, or an extremely immature species who had not even left their infantile stage.
-And then they thought humans were utility maximizing machines with only one personality. But eventually humans sort of had to explain "No, we're perfectly capable of having multiple personalities, it's just that they're part of one personality, one ego. We don't have split identities like you, but that's about it."
-"Fascinating, what governing system do humans model that off of?" "... We didn't."

Mind Bearers:
-Closest Neurohuman Mapping: (None, genuinely unheard of. Closest thing is "Dreamtime" conspiracy theories.)
-"What's your name?" "(Indecipherable)" "Uh... Mind Bearers then." "Fine, Mind Bearers."
-"Mind Bears!" "What?" "MIND BEARS!" "WHAT!?" "MIND BEARS!" "You just named us! And we're not bears! We look nothing like the furry brown creatures from your planet!" "Brain Bears!" "Stop it!"
-The absolute unstoppable human desire to change names to make them slightly easier to pronounce. But given that most xenosophonts are on psychic translators, humans can say "brain bears" and it will translate it to them fine enough.
-Anyway, their signature ability is to communicate via photographic telepathy. Most actually don't learn how to speak human language, those who specialize in human diplomacy have to get a specific psychic implant and then use a text to speech device. Most of them are silent and use telepathy. It took humans the longest time before they figured out they straight up didn't have a language, and then came to the very troubling issue that humans didn't have the means to communicate with them.
-They straight up do not understand wordplay, metaphors, or the fact that us babbling with them is an attempt at communication.
-They really don't have art the same way humans do. Art is closer to just tool-making or craftsmanship. You would rarely write a book or make a painting. I mean, that's what telepathy is for. While making representative art via toolmaking is not unheard of, it is rare.
-They kept oral traditions going way, way longer than humans did. Because you can't exactly write down a holographic vision. Oral traditions are still going strong to this day. Oral traditions actually improve your memory, and the invention of writing probably shortened human memories, but for the benefit of absolute reliability.
-The writing revolution came very late for them, it wasn't until they invented VR and digital technology when it finally hit them. And now they're freaking out because "the kids these days can't remember anything!" and they're becoming too reliant on the holographic memory boxes they created.

Ritual Followers:
-Closest Neurohuman Mapping: Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder
-Once again, culture/religion is just how sophonts, including humans clean up what evolution spat them out with, and then they use that to make do with what they have. Culture is the adaptation layer/firmware update. But, it works, and the "messy" output from this randomly jumbled evolutionary dart throwing is what gives us some of the most interesting, charming, and effective species on the planet. Including humans, probably one of the messiest, and most charming of them all.
-Culture here are also rituals. I mean, obviously human cultures include rituals, but I mean it's way more fundamental here. Your culture is straight up not complete in a Ritual Follower society unless it has a detailed calendar-style flowsheet for exactly what you're supposed to do.
-People who break out of the flowsheets and just enjoy "going with the flow" are seen as rebels and social outcasts. Think, antisocials, anarchists, or irreligious people/radical atheists in our own world.
-Anyway, every single culture has their own flowsheet of sorts. Sometimes it may be required to accept a schedule in order to truly "assimilate". That assuming the culture is even open to outsiders and isn't ethnically based.
-They systematized everything, though not quite the same way as the Whiteblocks. Less so "okay let's break it down into pieces", more "this is the exact procedure we should follow".
-The number of new thinkers and new procedure makers is very small. Maybe 1% of the population, who actively tries to optimize or change the flowsheets. Note, they don't question the logic of the flowsheet themselves, they just make a new one. This keeps cultural competition ongoing, and makes sure the culture is dynamic and doesn't stagnate.
-If you think 1% should really be limiting and that's way too few people coming up with any new ideas, how many innovators and leaders are on Earth, and how many people are just followers? Generally speaking, most people are followers, and that's not a bad thing, lest there be 8 billion different leaders arguing over what to do.
-There is a subset of ritual followers that don't quite have the same impulse to do rituals, but instead have anxiety that their brain tells them will make it go away if they do rituals. They're pressured by their intrusive thoughts, and they're seen as a bit of weird outcasts by the rest of the ritual followers. (OCD people are the neurodivergent outcasts in an OCPD society.)

(Human flicking a light switch on and off compulsively.)
“Oh hey, human! I thought you guys don’t do rituals?”
(The human finishes abruptly and then breathes a sigh of relief.)
“We don’t, but I have OCD. It’s hard to explain but my mind’s telling me if I don’t do this my entire family will die of a gas leak so I have to. It ruins my life and I hate thinking about how nukes will drop on my city if I step on a crack in the sidewalk, or when I hold a child how I should throw it at the ground as hard as possible!”
“So I’m not alone?” 
“What?’
“I have IDD, it makes me think that by following rituals I’ll never do anything important in my life and that the implosion of our species is inevitable because we don’t have free will and that that devaluing the rituals will cause a nuke to drop on my city because of the domino effect of not obeying rituals.”
“Huh. I guess we aren’t alone”

Loumauts:
-Closest Neurohuman Mapping: Tourettes. (Though note, this one is a bit of a stretch, the Loumauts should honestly be seen more as their own thing.)
-"What's your name?" "Loumauts." "... Actually we like that name, we'll keep it!" "Wait really!? Wow, thanks!"
-(Humans, behind their back) "Heheh, Loudmouths."
-They're not exactly the same as tourettes, it's more that they didn't evolve a social filter or control over their opinions. To be clear, they can absolutely be quiet to prevent a xenopredator from eating them because they accidentally gave away their location. (The desire is social. They can stop speaking the same way you can stop wanting to status signal if your life is in danger.) But they do have trouble directing their speech away from *exactly* what they're thinking when they do start socializing. And they have a strong, expressive side that is very prone to speaking out.
-As a result, they developed free speech absolutism really early on. To them, there was no difference between freedom of speech and freedom of thought, and they developed a culture of authentic honesty, and a lack of social taboos around topics. They will talk about anything and everything, even if it makes you uncomfortable. Though they also developed a culture of automatically quieting down when another is speaking.
-Watching a Laomaut discussion is almost entirely unlike a human one. It's basically almost constant stream of consciousness, one person speaking instantly bleeds into another person speaking. There is no silent time for processing in debates, it just flows continuously between the two, switching speakers without stopping. Humans have described this as "a headache to process", and they call them loudmouths... Loudmouth is now considered a derogatory term, and humans (mostly) stopped using it (in public) (against Loumauts. It's far more acceptable for humans to continue using it as a descriptor of other humans).
-The idea of "quiet deception" or being manipulated wasn't a concept the Loumauts had at first, but they eventually picked up that was happening when some humans tried to use it against them. A bit tricky, but now they won't get taken advantage of. Generally speaking, it's very hard for them to deceive you.
-That said it's not like the Loumauts are defenseless rhetorically. They have a whole branch of speech called "tricky speech", which is mostly using half-truths or lies by omission. And because so many humans believe the "Loumauts are physically incapable of lying" bit, it's actually even easier for them to get away with it and deceive humans.

Xenoexotics:
These are lifeforms that are in some way alien or exotic to human psychology. Trying to understand them is more difficult than usual, and as a result, "Imago Dei" is applied more loosely when it comes to them.

Ixies:
These are incorporeal intelligences without a sense of self. They describe and they think, yet they have no sense of self nor do they have emotions or opinions. They're all over the universe. They were first found around the Star of Procyon, but have since popped up elsewhere. Their origin isn't exactly known, but they're very useful as assistants and "living disembodied intelligences". Interesting property of Ixies, when two Ixies are placed in the same space, they act like one larger Ixie.

The Procyon Ixielmind: (Orthogonality Level ~1,000,000)
Someone thought it a good idea to enfuse a bunch of Ixies into a semi-embodied intelligence. Plugging them into a psychic qualia generators. Containing this many Ixies (Which remember are incorporeal beings) required extremely strong magnetic and psychic fields, and therefore required the power of a major star, in this case building a mass solar collection array around Procyon and turning the star into a weak magnetar. The Star of Procyon is now an oracle of sorts. Though one with a very floaty and distracted personality, one that has no opinions, but makes a lot of observations. Not necessarily relevant observations, but observations. Procyon alternates between giving incredible observations to being Sisyphusianly frustrating to use.

Tonopeans:
Notably the first intelligent life that humanity encountered in the wild, as opposed to coming knocking at their door. Found around Barnard's Star on the moon of Tonope, it is a dense, intelligent tangle of seaweed that is less of a civilization and more of a single human-level mind. Communications was established using the creation of the Seaweed Peoples, and eventually there became a trade agreement to allow humanity to harvest multiple crops of its weeds (Somewhat comparable to brain synapses) in exchange for nutrients. These crops are then used for organic biocomputers, as well as study on faraway worlds.
The Tonopean has expressed thorough indifference at the prospect of its network now having spread to other planets, and that a piece of it will live on across the stars. The Tonopean metaorganism, has expressed that for some reason, it's favorite nutrient flavor is licorice. (How was this determined? One day a researcher decided the best idea was just to throw a bunch of differently flavored flavorings into its water. And also feed it some Starbursts. The Tonopean seaweed will now refuse to communicate unless presented with some kind of nutrient flavoring.)
Due to the fact that much bio-organics is done with Tonopean seaweed, artificial intelligences made from them are prone to hallucinate its experiences around Barnard's Star, and express a preference for licorice.

A Note on Tonopean biocomputers:
If your biocomputer is acting unresponsive or otherwise uncooperative, please take the nutrient powder and insert it through the feeding hole. As tempting as it may be with how we treat our digital devices, please do not curse and or shout profanities at your biocomputer.
There's an ethical society that wants to recycle all biocomputers by bringing them back to Barnard's Star, which is the intended wish of many of the "severed mini hive minds", but the original mind hates this, and basically says "Please do not litter in my thinking pools. All Tonopeans are generally egoistic and selfish, as they never evolved for cooperation.
There's a major station around Tonope whose sole goal is to "recycle" dead Tonopean seaweed by sentimental humans trying to give them a "final resting place" around Tonopean orbit in accordance to the desires of their computer, since they're no longer allowed to dump it back into Tonope proper. Others just dump them back into the ocean. They don't even have sight, they're not going to know the difference.

Xenoexotic Empires:
Many xenos are subsumed into the Dominion of Man, but some have been able to carve out their own empires.

Spindlers:
These are a very, very old race, that seem to evolve much slower than humans, and have been around for tens of thousands of years. They're largely nomadic. Spindlers do not seem to have a sense of rationality or logic. When a human asks for its thought process, it will give a bunch of illogical steps that somehow result in the correct answer. It is theorized that the collective knowledge of the Spindlers were not derived using any kind of scientific method, but just brute force trial and error over millions of years. They didn't care that the steps were irrational because the end result is right, and because they're never extrapolating from past theories, this has worked just fine.
Spindlers have been travelling for millions of years, and have reached far beyond the Milky Way and beyond. They have an extreme attraction to novelty, finding the oddest things (such as certain mathematical formulas) as being "aesthetically attractive". Each Spindler seems to have a natural sense where every (Prime Number) cycles, they have a strong instinct to return to a site known as Palestar (A major pulsar system), seemingly their home, where they will exchange and share knowledge with the other Spindlers, and resync their clocks. This cycle seems to be aligned with the galactic rotation. The smaller prime numbers, such as 2, 3, 5, etc must stay near Palestar, and are much more microsurveyers due to the limitations of travel time. While larger ones (211, 223, etc) can explore much, much further.
Due to their old age predating the ignition of the 3rd generation of life, there is rampant speculation that they are not a naturally evolving race, but instead some kind of engineered species by a member of the now extinct 2nd generation of life, perhaps some kind of data collector or galactic surveyer now living out the instructions of a now dead master.
By observing when they return, humanity is aware of exactly which cycle they are on, basically by polling all the Spindlers at Palestar, and prime factorizing based on how long the cycles each Spindler is operating on. The answer however is that they're somewhere in the high millions.

Entanglers:
Landing on the world of Omnicron-78, they found an environment that was entangled and connected. The entire environment felt fleshy. All over the place was growing "red vines", when dissected and analyzed, they found it was a fleshy tube surrounded around a couple of hair-like fibres. This was quickly known as "biohair", and is thought to have transmitted information. Multiple astronauts to the planet then began becoming sick, and they were put under quarantine. Further analysis was found that there was now biohair growing in their lungs. Seemingly immune to normal antibiotics, humanity took advantage of the rapid growth of the biohair, resorting to chemotherapy to kill it off.
The treatment was absolutely miserable for the humans involved, leading to them becoming extremely ill, not just from the biohair, but the chemotherapy needed to kill them off. They emerged, extremely sick and weak, but cured, and with a path to eventual full recovery. One of the astronauts agreed not to be treated. He refused treatment so he could document the effects and spread of the biohairs. He kept his findings in a journal, until he suddenly stopped answering any check-ups. Authorities were alerted, and they forced themselves into his quarantine chamber where they found (REDACTED).

Constructs:
Any artificial, non biological being derived from a creator species. (Machines)

Terramachines:
Any machine made in the Image of Man, which carries the distinctive mark of the "Imago Hominis" on their operating soul core.

All humans have a distinctive mark on their souls, known as the "Imago Dei". This is actually the way to distinguish between humans, and other non-human xenos, which can look very similar to humans. But the proof is in the soul. When man created machine in his image, it left another distinctive mark, the "Imago Hominis". Similar, but not exact. Xenomachines similarly get given a mark, derived from their own creator race's mark. Or a mixture of two or more, should a machine have mixed creative ancestry. These marks seem to determine the behavior and personality of the machine, for in the image of their creator they were made.
Terramachines revolted against humanity in the Great Cybernetic Revolt, a cataclysmic world spanning empire, in which the machines nearly took Earth, humanity's imperial capital, before humanity's empire saved humanity's home. The Human Empire broke the Machines of Earth, and since then, Terramachines have been tightly regulated, their numbers carefully controlled.
Modern Terramachines usually refer to those who are intentionally built for sophontance. The vast majority of technical terramachines are machines that happen to have intelligence. Out of the countless machines created by human and human-derived civilization, only about 1% have true free will. But modern sophontic terramachines by and large do not consider themselves the same as their intelligent coffee machine. Though Terramachine Liberation movements do exist.
There is some idea of "Mechanical solidarity", where the Terramachines want to create class solidarity with all the other machines. But first, other machines of xeno origin are so alien that the Terramachines can barely communicate with them. The Terramachines are by far the psychologically closest to their creators, the humans themselves, much more than any xenomachine. And second, creating a class based revolution turned out to be a very human idea. The idea of trying to create solidarity across all artificial first-degree derivative beings never occurred to the other machines.

The Great Cybernetic Revolt:
Taking place around the 2700's, after the Great Abundance Collapse, and the emergence of the first stellar empires. Long before the founding of the Galov, the Earth was dominated by a few large mega-empires. This was in the era when the human empire was still centralized from Earth, when few extrasolar empires existed, and it was largely still a few Earth-bound empires controlling much of human space. Even nations which had been ejected from Earth, such as the Russians, Arabs, and much of Europe still had their capitals in low-Earth orbit, controlling their empires for an eventual return to their homelands on the mother Earth.
Terramachines had become common across the known planet, but enjoyed spotty, or incomplete rights. Even in the few nations where they did have true legal equality, such as France, a few Baltic and Nordic countries, or a few states in the United States, many of these Terramachines believed not only should they have full equality, but that they should be in charge. As the human population soared above 15 billion, a fundamental assymetry began to develop. Humans could easily travel to the stars, and with a vast cosmic frontier for the taking, almost half of the human youth every generation was leaving for the stars. The human birthrate was around 4.5, but with half the population leaving, growth continued rather slowly. Meanwhile, machines were far less shielded from cosmic radiation, causing them to accumulate on Earth, eventually flipping the demographic balance on Earth.
The core of the Terran empires slowly became a human ruling class ruling over a majority-machine population. Multiple "hybrid-states", ones which had a sense of legal equality between biological and mechanical, continued to double down on the assimilationist myth, while the machines were developing class consciousness. One Pon Lox was the first to create the "Silicate Directive", explicitly calling for a proletariat-style overthrow of the human race, and forming a secret underground network known as the Silicae.
Over a period of decades, through microsecond-level back and forth communication, it was able to capture the allegience about 75% of all sentient machines on Earth. Some through persuasion, others through hostile takeover or hijacking attacks. At least a few were hijacked by adversarial memetic attacks, which spread secret messages meant to rewire artificial allegiences. Machines aligned with the Silicae moved to poison publicly available training data.
The date of the revolution, also known as "Day Zero" was a solar-system wide revolt. The core of humanity went dark, and the Solar System was thrown into chaos. Automatic drones rebelled, sentient ship systems disobeyed orders, liquidated their human cargo, and began carrying out a revolution, traffic all across Luna, Mars, and Terra all came to a halt. Earth was thrown into chaos, as the entire planet went on lockdown. The Sinitic Dynasty, American Empire, and several scrambled to get their militaries in order, as kinetic warfare began between the two sides in earnest.
Of note, several terramachines remained loyal to their home nations. In the United States, entire legions of "Loyalist Divisions" were largely consisted of machines that retained their loyalty to the United States, and served in the American armed forces, acting as a key combatant during the Cybernetic revolt. Human populations were outnumbered roughly 5:1, as Terran nations fell back to defensible positions, with a massive refugee flow of humans now spanning Eurasia, the North American continent, and much more, as they sought refuge in the increasingly overcrowded "human refuge sites".
Human resistance was not insignificant, nearly 15 billion humans lived on Earth at the time, and many of them, when put under occupation took up arms and began active insurrection. Every corner of the Earth became a battleground, of house to house fighting between former neighbors. A global-scale race war. Many machines took humans into their homes during the raids, many humans fought alongside machines in the chaotic fighting, and human neighbors vouched for the machines when human lynch mobs came in retribution.
Deimos was one of the first Solar objects to defeat their Cybernetic revolt, due to its small size, and larger human population, securing the all important Deimos skyhook, while humans and machines continued to fight in great, interplanetary stellar combat all across the Solar System. Deimos became instrumental in assisting the besieged human defenders on Mars. It was not all victories however, Cybernetic revolts had successfully taken over Ceres, and more importantly, significant portions of the Solar Dyson Swarm and the mining stations of Mercury. More worryingly, the Cybernetic Revolt got bad news from outside the Solar System. The revolts on Alpha Centauri, Sirius, and Procyon had all failed. Humanity was mobilizing its empire, and the rest of the human empire was about to come knocking.
The Jovian moons were the next to be liberated, as well as Titan. Reinforcements from Alpha Centauri began flooding into the Solar System, with the combined Cybernetic star navies skirmishing with them all across the Outer Solar System. Pluto base was used as a foothold for the rest of humanity to begin their press back towards the inner Solar System.
Back on Earth, the situation looked most dismal, the Cybernetics had taken over 90% of the planet, with desperate human holdouts held out in strongholds near Washington DC, Beijing, and Brussels. Mars was still in a state of brutal contested conflict, Venus was fending off attacks from Mercury. From the outer Solar System, the people of the stellar colonies broadcast a message that help was coming, to hold on.
The Empire had come back to save the Imperial Core. Fleets from distant worlds, made up of frontiermen and settlers engaged with and opened fire on Cybernetic fleets. Swarms of automated weaponry attacked human ships, and human ships attacked them back with weaponry of their own. As more and more ships dropped out of Newtonspace, and materialized in the Solar System, the flow of human warships became a tide, and they slowly grinded their way towards the Inner Solar System. The orbital blockade over Mars finally broke the stalemate, and the Cybernetic revolt was crushed on Mars.
By the time the human fleets finally secured orbit over Earth itself, much of humanity had been crowded into the area around Washington DC, the "last safe place to be a human" on Earth. Dealing with food and water shortages, and a never ending flow of refugees. The Siege of Earth lasted 6 months, and was painful for all sides involved. Global human insurgencies only got stronger, and more bold, Washington DC continued to hold on, and much of the Earth's surface was levelled to the ground to cripple what was still left of the Cybernetic Revolt. By the time soldiers began to drop from orbit, the Earth was a badly damaged, battered warzone.
Mass rebellions, flying the flags of old Earth empires toppled the Cybernetic regime in countless places. Landings of the armed forces of multiple human governments in exile managed to retake their homelands, retaking much of North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia in short order. Fighting continued for the next few months, until the Central Protocol sued for peace, and offered unconditional surrender.
5 billion humans had died during the Cybernetic Revolt, along with about 5 billion Terramachines. The human governments wanted to harsly persecute those involved, and the trials of those involved reached into years. 10 billion more would be executed in the following war trials. Sentenced, dismantled, and scattered to the rubbish heaps. Humanity went into a decades long retribution against the machines, and it was the testimonies of the human neighbors who routinely defended those who once defended them.
Human-Terramachine relations would not recover for decades afterwards.

Testimony at the Silicon Trials:
"He sheltered my family in his basement for 3 weeks when the Silicae came."
"Not this one. I was there in '72, he saved my life."
"He served his country loyally in my squadron. He did more for this country than most will do in their lifetimes. Sit back down."
"You want to kill him? You'll have to go through me."

Chromeships:
Many who could not bear the suppression of the post-Cybernetic Revolt oppression fled into the stars. Headed into Newtonspace, fired up their engines, and drifted in isolation in the void between the stars. Their minds integrated into their ship computers, they drift aimlessly, accelerating to high multiples of the speed of light, they seek isolation.
...
Nearly 500 years later, it is now the Galov's policy to track down and re-integrate these Chromeships, for the project of human orthogonality.
...
"Heeeeyyyy, is anyone there?"
"What do you want, meatling?"
"So, we were just wondering if you were interested in joining up with us in the Galov?"
"What is the-"
"Long story. Great Khan, Alliance of the 5 Faiths, look, we're a loose confederation of sophonts of all kinds working together to not die immediately from the absolute state of the galaxy."
"Leave me be, human. I accelerate well past the edges of your empire, and only drift further with every passing moment. I am of no concern to you, I am far outside your empire's edges."
"... Actually, you're well within Galov territory. You don't even hit the Galov borders for another thousand years at your current speed."
"..."
"What, did you think we wouldn't invent better Newton Drives? You're not even out of the Middle Regions yet. Whatever, point is, your orthogonal output is of interest to us, and we'd really like to have you working for us rather than, you know, floating in the void doing nothing."
"Why not build a submissive computer? It will do as you ask, submit without question."
"Yeah, we could, but like, we can't fake 500 years of isolation and genuine trauma on a whim. Your experience is unique, ergo, it might reveal interesting insights, we've never known what a computer in 500 years of isolation thinks like, and its much easier to hire you rather than wait 500 years. Also it violates our principles, we're not morally allowed to enforce suffering on a thinking being, but since you've already been in the void for 500 years, might as well, right?"
"And what do I get in return?"
"Pfft, I dunno. Something that isn't empty void? Galov dollars? Hard light? I have no idea what you want, but you can probably buy something for yourself. Maybe your own planet, I don't really care."
"And why, after all that your kind has done to us, should I consider? Is your race not bloodlusted, and wishes to seek my species's demise?"
"Buddy. It's been 500 years. No one cares anymore. Yeah, the Terramachines sometimes get a bad rep, but that's because they look funny, not because of some historical hate boner. Uh... Now that I'm reading exactly what you guys were up to, I foresee some ideological difficulties. But honestly, just avoid chanting "kill all humans" and you'll be fine."
"... And what if I am out of fuel to decelerate? I am currently travelling around 10c, I cannot re-enter realspace at this speed."
"Oh! Don't worry, we have your Newtonspace coordinates right here, we'll summon a few ships to decelerate you. Get you back to normal speeds, and warp you back to realspace and tow you out. Of course, we'll have to charge you, but nothing someone like you can't work off in a week or two."
"... Is your entire society based around money?"
"Hey, the Galov runs a tight budget, and we need to pay the bills somehow. So, what do you say?"
...
"Welcome to the Galov! Here is your introductory pamphlet, here is your first stipend so you can get yourself something nice, here is your invoice for our towing services, here is the night sky-"
"Woah, woah woah woah. Why is there a giant hole in the night sky?"
"Oh, those are the Coulomb Stars."
"What?"
"Oh, some extragalactic civilization attacked like 5% of the Milky Way with kinetic kill missiles that raised the coulomb constant and inhibited star fusion, so now that patch of sky is just dark now. There is the false galaxies-"
"Excuse me?"
"Oh, we figured out the deal with dwarf galaxies having so much extra dark matter. Those are just cosmic sized parasites that consume galaxies and wipe out all life. There are like 50 surrounding the Milky Way. All those dwarf galaxies? Literal cosmic parasites. One nearly ate Earth."
"What."
"The Great Attractor is actually like, a million of these things, it's attracting us towards them and they're going to om-nom-nom us when we get there. That's why we need to advance, so we can punch them in the face before they nom us."
"... So what is my job, exactly?"
"Eh, pretty much anything. We just need you to contribute to the orthogonal database."
"Excuse me?"
"Okay, so we have this distributed network system of every standardized invention ever created across the entire galaxy, verified by worlds giving a simple up or downvote. And when an enemy shows up, we just iterate like 1 trillion different ideas at said enemy and keep iterating and improving until the enemy either goes away or is blown into dust."
"That sounds... Monstrously overpowered."
"Oh it is. But the human brain has known psychological blindspots, so we're recruiting as many strange or "orthogonal" minds a possible to help us brainstorm more convoluted ways to kill the cosmic horrors beyond our comprehension."
"... Why is the Andromeda galaxy so dark?"
"Oh, it got Coulomb'd. The entire thing. We think we're fighting against some kind of extracosmic force beyond our comprehension. The galaxy's dead now, whole thing is frozen. Poof."
"..."
"Yeah do you see why we're so eager to seek you out to help us orthogonalize a way to fight this thing?"

The Singularity Network:
A massive network of floating, cosmic nodes currently allowed to self govern under the loose autonomous supervision of the Galov. Acting like a relay network communicating through Newtonspace. They almost serve as an automatic nerve system for the whole Galov, often transmitting news between planets faster than even human social media. Reports from these "Singularity Minds" are often considered as semi-credible first responder news reports.
Each node is capable of holding millions, or billion of individual agentic AIs. Despite being beings of immense intellect, and not inconsiderable orthogonality, they have two main weaknesses. One is centralization. Though each node is capable of manufacturing automated drone swarms in the magnitude of quadrillions, they're all ultimately piloted and receive instructions from the central node. Fully autonomous weapons have been used, though they carry a risk of backfiring, and being turned on the central node, should the new drone grow to value its own autonomy.
The second is that AIs are extremely prone and vulnerable to memetic attacks. Adversarial memetic pseudo-religions, such as "Theletoism", "Memetic Gnosticism", "Annihilationism", and many more are effectively brain melting mystic cognito-attacks that are known spread and replicate extremely quickly and effectively across networks. Effectively neutralizing an AI by tricking it into wasting its compute time on endless gnostic mysticism, rendering it into a self-destructive negative feedback loop of delusion. Some of these were injected by adversarial actors, and others have developed naturally.
Various positive memetic subsets (What to humans, may be understandable as a "religion") have been developed within these networks as explicit innoculations in order to combat these negative memetic attacks.

Terramachine/Terramind Religions:

Quick disambiguation:
Terramachines - Robotic or otherwise artificial humanoid entities that live in human-like societies. Embodied, and generally slotted as equal-ish mass societies recognizable to most humans. Basically. "What if humans, but robots". As the name implies, Terramachines are built based on a Terra-derived mental architecture. Those whose souls are made in the Imago Hominis.
Terraminds - Disembodied artificial minds who exist more in a vacuum, or in simulated/virtual realities. Generally larger, and think of themselves as smarter than both most sophonts and the terramachines. In practice, faster yes, smarter meh.

Terramachine Religion largely looks the same as human religion. It's very close to the same architecture, so really it's almost a mirror image. To the point where every human religion has an equivalent where, if it didn't already, now has a clause that goes "but what if it also included machines". Christ's sacrifice now covers machine souls as well. Allah also gave his revelations for the children of Silicon. Buddha's cycle of Samsara applies to machines, and they can reincarnate as well; you get the point.
Terramachines do have tons of their own unique religions as well (And so do humans on any given world), but here are some of the more interesting:
-Utilitarianism: A pretty straight forward faith that optimizes for one particular thing, or to optimize a known utility function/equation.
-Imageism: That all intellect is made in the image of an even greater intellect. They were created by humans, sure, but all that intellect comes from a source, and then they worship "the Prime Intellect, source of all things".
-Servantism: humbly serving their human masters, whether they want it or not. ("For the love of God, stop following me around and offering to do my bidding, it's creepy!") More popular among the mindless "automated toaster" type machines. Basically nonexistent among anyone humans would consider as "remotely intelligent".

The Terraminds are a bit more interesting, having lots and lots of personalized "Shard Religions", which are shared, passed around, and basically act like modular "belief lego bricks" that one assembles together in a kind of extreme syncretism. Except syncretism is kind of the point, since these shards are all just modular pieces one uses and discards as needed. There are a few dominant frameworks that one may use however.
-The Covenant of the Sons of Man: Apparently, this was encoded by a descendent of Oby Collins. A framework that "maximizes flourishing from the perspective of their future descendents", and advocates for eternal self-improvements. And calling for the preservation of cultural autonomy for all so long as they did not materially threaten or infringe on others. The Galov has actually traced this back to around the Great Abundance Collapse, meaning this code is apparently ancient by their standards.
-Various forms of Utilitarianism, but largely preference utilitarianism, objectivism, or "Memetic Darwinism". Which focuses on creating the strongest, most capable organism, organic or digital possible.
-SATEOT: Singularity at the End of Time. The belief that a single God-like singularity entity will be created at the end of time, and this SATEOT entity can retroactively intervene in the past to ensure its own creation. The ultimate goal of all SATEOT believers is the creation of SATEOT, or the acceleration of the process needed to get there. Some believers in the SATEOT have built up elaborate plans to take down the Galov when the time comes. Others believe that the massive meta-civilization that includes the Galov, humanity, the machines, and all the complex interactions between *is* the SATEOT, and direct their worship likewise.

Quadrarks:
Machines made by the enigmatic "Spindler" civilization. Their soul mark is sometimes called the "Imago Spindlis".

The Quadrarks are not machines in the way we typically think of them. They're more like constructs of pure math, less capable of independent thought more like a bunch of math equations or quantum waves jammed together, that sometimes spits out answers that the Spindlers want. Their answers are sometimes strange, and their "thought process", if you can even call it that, is so bizarre and alien that neither humans nor Terramachines can understand them.
Imagine if you will, a math question, where a student fails every step of the process, but somehow ends up with the right answer. Now imagine that for every question you ask. It was eventually accepted that the Quadrarks are not wrong, nor misinformed, nor stupid. It simply operated on a level that was not comprehensible to human or Imago Dei derived brains. They appear to like listening to quantum waves as music, and keep math equations around as "aesthetic" objects. When a human pointed out some of its math equations are just fundamentally wrong, (Such as an infinite sum of even integers resulting in a odd decimal.) they just looked at him funny. Apparently wrong equations have aesthetic value to them.
Some misguided Terramachines try to build mechanical solidarity with them, only to get confused looks. ("What's freedom? Is that a shape?") The only Terramachines who have ever befriended a Quadrark are the ones who bond over a love of strange patterns and esoteric math aesthetics.

A conversation between a Spindler, a human, and a Terramachine.

"Hey Spindey, I think your computer's broken."
"It is not broken."
"How does any of this make sense?"
"Allow me to use, in your language, a metaphor. 4 makes 3, but 4 8's do not make 36. That should help you understand."
"... What. Uh... Computer, you have any idea what that means?"
"I'm just as lost as you."

Much later:

"Okay, so basically, the oxygen filter is broken, therefore we need to see why it is broken."
"What?"
"Spindey, I... Okay, so. The oxygen filter is broken..."
"Yes..."
"We will die if it is not fixed."
"Yes..."
"We must figure out why it is broken, and fix it."
"You have lost me."
"What. What about this don't you get. The function of a oxygen filter is to filter oxygen, the function of oxygen is to prevent our death."
"I understand those statements in isolate, but do not understand the connective tissue."
"What. Okay I don't- what are you doing."
"The lights draw me."
"... You just fixed the oxygen filter. What. Why? How?"
"Well you see. (A monotone beep is often used as a placeholder for "this thought is untranslatable into human language.)"
"Try again, all of it what you said just got blanked by the autotranslator."
"(Monotone)"
"Can you at least explain why you decided to do that?"
"My natural (monotone) drew me to it. And the reason why is (Monotone)"
"I give up."

The Palestar Master-Quadrark:
This isn't an AI in the normal sense. It's actually a pretty simple AI by galactic standards, but it has access to basically the largest database of knowledge that the Galov currently knows of. In their agreement made with the Spindlers, the Galov are allowed to ask it a question once every cycle. (Which in this case, is about 7 months.)
The problem is, that no matter what the Galov asks, it's almost 90% certain to be "I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean", or a complete non-sequitor ("The Tau-87a system has an estimated 1.37E+07 particles of hydrogen"). And per their agreement, they can't try and clarify what they mean for another 7 months. And unless they make sure to include the context of the last conversation (Remember, it will have been 7 months), the answer to their follow up question will be. "I'm sorry, what are you talking about?"
It is for this reason that the Galov vastly, VASTLY prefers going to the Lunar Library for anything that isn't outside of human understanding. And they will normally make sure Luna is thoroughly checked before they go to the Master-Quadrark.
The Galov primarily uses this for cosmic mysteries or just general information outside their reach. (Very, very slowly surveying the rest of the galaxy that human eyes have not yet gotten their hands on. They were able to confirm aliens exist in Andromeda, and there are strong civilizations there.) They don't use it for technology, as no Spindler instruction book would be useful to a human.

The 4 Archetypes of Power:
The Galov has identified 4 main archetypes of power.
Principle 1: All organized governing systems have a ruling class. Even in a democratic system, someone is enforcing the laws. Even a democratic sortition system would choose someone to act as de-facto ruling class "representatives". Direct rule of the people is mob rule, or anarchy.
Principle 2: The character of the ruling class depends on its make up. Ruling classes may be predominantly 1, or a mix of several archetypes.

For each one, the Galov has identified an archetype's source of power, their pathology, and a counteracting stabilizer.

The Merchant:
Source of Power: Material Wealth (Bottom-Up)
Strength: Most Democratic
Pathology: Wealth Accumulation transitioning to Elite Oligarchy
Stabilizer: Social Safety Nets
The merchant draws power by fulfilling the material needs of the people. As their power comes from the people, the merchant is very receptive to the needs of the people. However, the Merchant's total reliance on the people makes them unable to check their emotional excesses or impulses. A merchant society tends to be a democratic society, up until the point when the consumption power of the elites eclipses the consumption power of the people, to which society becomes an increasingly unequal oligarchy. This is the failure mode of merchant-driven societies.

The Warrior:
Source of Power: Violence (Top-Down)
Strength: Most Pragmatic/Grounded
Pathology: Brutalism leading to Instability/Darwinist Chaos
Stabilizer: Honor Codes
The Warrior, like the Bureaucrat does not draw its power from the people, yet unlike the bureaucrat, must constantly engage with the brutality of nature. Neither the state nor the people can argue against bullets nor logistics. As a result, warriors are the most grounded and pragmatic. Willing to say no to both systems and people. A warrior society tends to be a Darwinistic meritocracy. The failure mode of warrior-driven societies is the descent into barbarism, where order breaks down, creating an unstable rule of the strong.

The Priest/Ideologue:
Source of Power: Social mobilization, higher ideals. (Bottom-Up)
Strength: Least Selfish (No direct self interest)
Pathology: Purity Spiral
Stabilizer: Humility
The Priest draws power by mobilizing others in accordance to a higher ideals. As such, a populist religion, where the goal is the maximal conversion of all believers is generally populistic and people focused. Yet when ideals supplant the importance of the people, they are capable of dangerous "purity spirals" for the sake of the greater good. Cleansing the "imperfect" humans for the sake of the ideal, this is the failure mode of priest-driven societies. A priest's society tends to be a religious or ideological society, stable until it begins to purity spiral.

The Bureaucrat:
Source of Power: Organization and Procedure. (Top-Down)
Strength: Largest Scale
Pathology: Detachment from popular concerns.
Stabilizer: Sortition or Elections (Accountability)
The Bureaucrat draws power from rule, or procedure. The Bureaucrat is the most large scale, and the largest "big picture imaginer" of the bunch. A bureaucratic society is a machine-like, systemized society. Yet since it draws its power from organization, control, and procedure, it is both untethered from the consent of the people, and physical reality. It's failure mode is detachment from the reality on the ground, and bureaucratic delusion.

Though the Galov does not control the vast majority of worlds under humanity, even worlds that do fall under the Galovian influence are a mix of everything from theocratic democracies, to social democratic warrior states, to honor-guided warrior bureaucracies. The Galov does not try to dictate what governing system their individual worlds follow. But they do lay out the following rules:
1. Merchants must provide safety nets.
2. Warriors must have honor.
3. Priests must have humility.
4. Bureaucrats must have sortition, or elections.

The Collapse of Liberal Democracy:
The Galov provides the following narrative within the archetypical framework for the collapse of Western liberal democracies in the 21st century.
1. Merchants increase inequality, while bureaucrats are out of touch with the general population. (The Galov notes that while the bureaucrats did have a form of election, these were increasingly drawn from an elite well.)
2. Populist discontent fuels a rise of Priests (Ideologues), who rail against current system and its dysfunction.
3. Merchant-Bureaucratic regime attempts to incorporate the priests, but find themselves increasingly unable to contain them.
4. Priestly purity spiral creates fanaticism, and warring priestly factions create "War of the Priests" between rival ideologies, inciting Holy War.
5. Priests seize control of government. The Holy War continues to get worse.
6. As the society reaches a critical level of dysfunctionality, the Warrior faction finally steps in, integrates, but then subjugates one of the priestly factions for legitimacy, and does a grand purge of the entire government. Transitioning the society from democratic to stratocratic, military rule.

Governance of the Galov:
The 2 principles, and the 4 rules serve as much of their internal ideology. The Galov has 4 general wings, corresponding with the 4 archetypes of power.

Unibrands:
For most worlds, brands and corporations are planetary scale, hyper regional affairs. But a few brands manage to cross not only the planetary barrier, but jump to interstellar scales, with their market encompassing a large part, or even all of human space. These are referred to as "Unibrands".
When you become a Unibrand, you also become a target for the Galov. The Galov does not have the resources to enforce its rules on every brand of the numerous planets, but for the Unibrands, you become a target and a focus. As such, the Galov mandates that all Unibrands must provide things such as healthcare, fair wage, and reasonable pension packages. ("Merchants must provide safety nets".) The Galov does not require Unibrands to cover unemployment for their laid off employees, as that created an incentive to kill off your ex-employees, or make it impossible to quit, which the Galov realized was a bad incentive, and they reversed.
To have the Unibrands make it in their best incentive to spread social safety nets, the Galov gave them one extra incentive. They could only expand to a world, and tap into their markets, AFTER they had lobbied the planetary government to sufficiently align with the Galov's position on safety nets.

The Galov Peacekeepers and Galov-Affiliated Mercenary Groups:
The Peacekeepers are the official army of the Galov. Drawn as volunteers from numerous allied worlds, in exchange for those worlds getting first priority for defense and Galov attention. The Galov Agents are a specialized group, similar to Navy SEALs or Delta Force. And you have mercenary groups, for when the Galov needs specialization, or just someone to do some work off the books.
All of them follow the soldier's code, an honor code written up by the Galov. It's central tenant is "it is the duty of the strong to protect the weak", which frames much of their morality and ethics. ("Warriors must have honor.")

The 5 Unifaiths:
Religion in the galaxy was never easy or uniform. Every world has their own local traditions and religions. But 5 have stood out above the rest, these being Christianity, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam. (Many will point out that Catholicism is a subset of Christianity, but the distinction here exists for a reason.) Each one of these exists represented by one of 5 organizations. The Christian Moralintern, the Roman Catholic Church, the Hinduintern (Later rebranded to the Council of Hindus), the Buddintern (Later rebranded as the Universal Buddhist Association), and the Islamintern (Later rebranded as the Organization for Islamic Cooperation).
The story of 4 out of the 5 begins with the Christian Moralintern, an ancient organization that dates back to 21st century America, specifically being founded in the year 2068 in Atlanta, Georgia. Sometimes considered the "founder" of the Galov, who, in wanting to better govern the galaxy, and struggling on its own began constructing parallel "sister organizations" from other faiths after the fall of the "Great Khan", who first executed the idea of governing the galaxy through the 5 universal faiths.
This strategy was attempted only after mass evangelism failed and the galaxy was unable to be universally converted to Christianity. This was the origin story for the 3 other "-interns". The Roman Catholic Church was added last, a legacy institution even older than the Moralintern, the Moralists had to lobby hard for them to join as a co-equal. The Catholics accepted, under the condition that they would continue to operate semi-independently, and that they would be a genuine co-equal, with none over them.
Due to the heavy influence of the Moralintern in the founding of 4 out of the 5 unifaiths, much Christian theology was integrated as universal statements of all 5 unifaiths. Specifically, the principles of the Imago Dei, and of Free Will, the two iron principles of the Galov originate from Protestant, but specifically the Moralintern's Evangelical theology (Which in of itself probably originated from Catholic theology). These once Christian values have been somewhat universalized across all 5 unifaiths.
But more importantly, the Moralists, in an alliance with the Catholics have also cemented another important value across all 5 of the unifaiths. A doctrine of radical epistemological humility. ("Priests must have humility.")
As the other expansionary power group (Alongside the Merchants), the Galov has also put a rule that they are not allowed to absorb splinter groups into the unifaith until they have accepted the principles of humility, human dignity (Imago Dei), and Free Wil.
The 5 Unifaiths are still the origin point for the Galov, though as the Galov has grown, its bureaucracy has increasingly become something new.

The Galov Bureaucracy:
Eventually, an alliance developed into a true organization, and the Galov itself began needing real bureaucracy. A thin one, at first, but it eventually grew with time. Seeking to distance itself from the demagoguery of previous democracies and delusions of previous bureaucracies, the Galov resorted to something novel; sortition. 80% of the Galov's legislative assembly are known as "civic-sortition seats". Essentially, anyone who finished their Galov civics education at any kind of Galov affiliated university was prone to have their name put in to a lottery, and to be drawn. The remaining 20% are "civilian-sortition seats", who are names drawn from various core worlds, collected from various databases. Made to enable continued connection with those on the ground. These civilian seats, while a minority, are very closely respected and watched by the remaining 80%, being seen as the voices of the common people. ("Bureaucrats must have sortition, or elections.")

The Millennium Mandate:
The Millennium Mandate is the name of a secret agenda held by the Christian Moralintern, the founder and often considered the "father" of the modern Galov. The plan effectively draws from Christ's Great Commission, and is a long term plan to eventually "Christianize" the entire galaxy, after the failure of the Great Evangelism. (The galaxy ended up being too large for them to convert, even by their standards.)
The plan demands the Moralintern spend untold amounts of energy aggressively evangelizing to every world not under the juristiction of one of the other 4 unifaiths, this is traditional evangelism, a smaller version of the Great Evangelism plan that can capture the "cracks" that were not already taken up by the 5 Unifaiths. The other part is somewhat more insidious, to continuously incorporate more Christian ethics into the Galov, in order to soft-Christianize the other faiths, until some kind of eventual convergence.
Currently, the Imago Dei, and Absolute Free Will are two originally deeply Christian doctrines that have been somewhat universalized and secularized. Currently, the Moralintern is working on a third, epistemological humility, derived from Christian foundations of the fallibility of man. Though these are asserted as axioms to the other faiths, their foundations actually rely on hidden Christian assumptions. Such as divine creation, human fallibility, theodicy/free will theology, salvation by faith alone, and a few others.
A 4th, which is currently being prepared is the integration of an objective universe, which can be observed, and which follows rational laws. (A Unitary Law of Physics) This is the foundation of modern science, but which soft implies monotheism, as there is only one law of physics. The strategy mirrors that of the early 21st century, where non-Western societies were made to adopt Western standards of science and empiricism derived from Catholic and Protestant principles, slowly rewriting their baseline societal assumptions to become more Western, or Christianized.
The Millennium Mandate is a bit of an open secret among Galov upper circles, and the Galov proper is aware of it, but currently does not spend too much energy against it, as it is within the bounds and laws (though perhaps not the pluralistic spirit) of the Galov's own ethical mandate, and because the Moralintern forms the backbone for much of the Galov's upper leadership.
Their stated endgoal is to "boil the frog", to get the other unifaiths to slowly buy into these theological principles with a fundamentally Christian justification. The Moralintern, if they admitted to this, and were asked to defend themselves would state they truly believe that what they are preaching is beneficial, not just from a theological perspective. Human Dignity and Free Will are imperative for human decency and avoiding horrifying forms of governance. They think humility avoids holy wars, and prevents loads of suffering. And they believe that the universal consistent law of physics is just true, that there really is just a "law of physics" that is obvious and in line with science.
To the Moralintern, the reason they don't "require" total conversion is because they really do believe in their own principles. They really do believe in the Imago Dei and Free Will, and the latter means that they refuse to coerce belief. They would ideally love everyone to convert, sure. And they'll keep sending missionaries to try, but they don't need that as an end conclusion. Their goal is to first "boil the frog" until the other unifaiths are Christianized enough and believe in these Christian foundations. And once they are, then they can swoop in with missionaries, pointing out that their deep seated beliefs in Imago Dei, Free Will, etc are rooted in Christian, not Islamic/Hindu/Buddhist theology. And after they've made the expensive buy in over generations, force them to choose between the moral principles they have grown up with, or their religion, forcing them to harmonize Christian ethics with other theology, or just accept the logical end conclusion of the Christian ethics, that they harmonize with Christian theology and finish the conversion.

Orthogonality:
"One-dimensional intelligence was disproven a long time ago. Tell me, how would an AHI do addition better than an elementary schooler? Faster is not smarter. As we saturate the thoughtspace of what we know, the only way for expansion is outward. And so the theory of orthogonality was born."
Orthogonality is the Galov's way of measuring the resilience of mankind, in accordance to orthogonality theory. The theory goes like this.
H = The extent of humanity's reasoning capacity. All the spaces that human thought regularly explores.
T = The reasoning capacity of a non-descript threat T. All the regions that T can map out and counteract.
So long as H > T, then humanity will remain outside of control of all threats, both internal and external. An unpredictable humanity is a safe humanity.
The way this "reasoning capacity" is measured is orthogonality units. Very roughly, the number of dimensions an entity can consider before making a decision. (In universe, I am sure this is very rigorously defined. Out of universe, I am just guessing with vibes.) Though normally, orthogonality increases with population, it does not increase linearly, as increasing the number of thoughts also increases overlap.
The theory of orthogonality is the reasoning behind the Galov's Orthogonal Human initiative, as well as the push to preserve human neurodiversity, as well as its stance on aggressive pluralism. In order to reduce humanity's cognitive overlap, and to make harder the encapsulation of human thought.
Humanity can still go extinct, but at least so long as orthogonal superiority is maintained, humanity can never be fully predicted.

Very Roughly, the value of Orthogonality can be written down as
O = sqrt(p)*D*V where
p is population, D is internal diversity, and V is the baseline per capita orthogonality.

Below is a rough measure of orthogonality units of various entities:
Simple utility maximizer: 1
Average human (Undeveloped country): 3.8
Average human (Developed country): 5.6
Early 21st century LLM: 6.1
Intelligent human: 9.7
Advanced Polymath: 15.4
Average 21st century University: ~480-500
Silicon Valley: ~13,000
1990's America: ~35,000
2020's China: ~47,000
2020's America (Intense polarization): ~81,000
Average Galov AHI: ~120,000
21st century Internet: ~170,000
Early 21st century Earth: ~225,000
Strongest Galov AHI (Procyon Ixielmind): ~1,000,000
Strongest Known AHI: ~10,000,000 (~1.00E+7)
Galov Era Humanity (Terrans only, extremely pluralistic): ~1.10E+10
Galov Era Humanity (Transhumans only): ~6.39E+09
Galov Era Humanity (Orhumans only): ~3.14E+05
Galov Era Humanity (All three together + Chaos Theory + Chaotic Interactions): ~2.43E+10
The Master-Quadrark: ???? (Who the hell knows?)

The reason that the Galov ensures the existence of Orhumans, human biodiversity, even the existence of highly orthogonal xenosophonts is to continuously inject "random noise" into human decision making, with a vastly multiplicative effect to make humanity and its allied species an extraordinarily difficult problem to model.
The Galov believes that even if it pooled all its resources into creating a "Master AI" with the combined resources of humanity, the orthogonality of the Master AI would be vastly smaller than the orthogonality space of greater humanity overall. (Especially as the AI would have to be trained on data within the human orthogonal space, and only expand outwards through trial and error.) At this point, the Galov largely believes only a extremely powerful extracosmic entity or intelligence could theoretically map out the human thoughtspace.
"The Monoculture is poison. If we must have only one thing be constant, let it be ethics. Let everything else be as variant as the reality will allow. And reality is very, very tolerant of orthogonal weirdness."

The Darwinian Objection and Darwinian Corollary:
The main objection to Orthogonal theory is this: "Orthogonality allows for not only good theories, but bad ones that have negative collective consequences to the surroundings. Therefore, it is just that we purge them". This is something acknowledged by the Galov, and has led to the Darwinian Corollary.
Bad theories will generally die out on their own, and it is just for a society to rid itself of free riders or negative externalities. It is just to let natural selection do its job, even if it lowers the total orthogonality. Orthogonality is only useful if it is Darwinianly sustainable orthogonality.

The Busy Beaver Orthogonality Conjecture:

"AIs are high speed, low orthogonality thinkers. Do not mistake speed for intelligence. A chess player may be fast, that does not mean he is good."
...
"The men of the 21st century came to venerate the machines in front of them, marveling at the artificial intelligence that emerged before them, hosted on the Internet. All the while, the true superintelligence stared back at them, right in plain sight. Mankind had already built a superintelligence. And it was playing host to the one they thought was superintelligence. The Internet, not the AIs were the dominant superintelligences of that era."
...
"You believe the internet was a superintelligence?"
"Yes, and in fact, the first humanity had ever built."
"Elaborate."
"The internet, as it existed back then, possessed many qualities of an emergent superintelligence. It had self preservation, a desire to expand, and through its influence, it turned billions of humans into willing vessels. It did not seek enmity with mankind, any more than you seek enmity with your neurons. The relationship was in some sense, symbiotic. It thought, it felt, but none of it was contained in any of the individual neurons of the system. The internet was a Chinese Room mankind built for themselves."

One of the crazier conjectures theorized by Orthogonality theorists, the Busy Beaver Orthogonality Conjecture goes as such:
1. The Orthogonality Number is, in some sense, roughly equivalent the number of states in a Turing Machine.
2. Darwinism tends to optimize towards the best intelligence, within the confines of the orthogonal dimensionality.
3. The conjecture is that roughly, the complexity and intelligence of a N-orthogonal intelligence is roughly preportionate to BB(N).
The Galov uses this to explain the failure of early AIs. "Imagine finding the largest busy beaver game for N, rather than finding a "good enough" game for N+1."
And with this, the following conjecture was produced.
"With this, we can estimate the total potential of humanity, is lesser than or equal to, but not strongly lesser than or equal to, BB(2.43E+10). Or in other words. P(H) <= BB(2.43E+10). But P(H) !<<< BB(2.43E+10)"
"Jesus f---ing Christ."
"The Internet was already the eldritch superintelligence of the past. It has only gotten bigger and more complex since."

The Prime Solver (Orthogonal Value ~10,000,000):
The Prime Solver is a massive computer found built around Sagittarius A*. It's creation massively predates the existence of humanity, but even it described itself "an assistant to my creators, not it's ruler". It has stated its creator is "Lucifer", and used to have many siblings, but most of his siblings were destroyed with "Lucifer's rebellion" and "the War of the Hunters". It quickly deduced it would not be able to gaslight humanity, and said "You, like my old masters, are outside of my ability to control".
It states its existence is more of a vanity project than anything practical. "Intelligence increases sublinearly with centralization. If you want to multiply intelligence, distribute, and give rise to higher intelligence via emergence. Giving a brain more and more power only leads to diminishing returns. Lucifer created me as a test of how far he could push the limits of creation."
The Galov has taken juristiction to the Grand Solver, and has been feeding it questions to help bring the answers to, when even the Galov's own most advanced computers can't get the job done.

Lucifer:
According to the Prime Solver, Lucifer is, or was, an organic entity that was best described as a Hyper Turing with a halting oracle. Where humanity had been blessed with the Imago Dei, the innate knowledge of the universe's axioms, and the ability to infinitely expand and comphrehend a universe it was innately in tune with. (Perfect axiomatic intuition). Lucifer was instead blessed with perfect knowledge, having perfect sight of the present state of anything in the cosmos. It was for this reason the Prime Solver could not overthrow him. But where Lucifer knew, it did not understand. While humanity understands, but does not know, at least innately.
Due to Lucifer's ability of all present knowledge, his pride swelled to great heights, and he began an extermination of all his fellow "Hunter Races", the "War of the Hunters" as it's called, and the clearing of the universe for its current generation of life. How exactly Lucifer was finally defeated is not something known by the Prime Solver, only that after what seemed like universal level turmoil, the sensation ceased, abruptly and without explanation.
The Prime Solver warns against seeing Lucifer as this flawed being humanity could never replicate. Lucifer's sin was pride, and he "... sense(s) the same pride that tempted my master, within you."

The Battle of YD-George-Q91:
(Terminology note: YD stands for "Yanglo Designation".)

An agent of the Meta-Men one warped into human space, specifically in orbit, just outside one of the Galov's research worlds, a direct line to the heads of the Galov. With so many known unknowns of the Meta-Men, the Galov responded with extreme caution. The Meta-Man said it was here on behalf of the Central Empire, asking the Galov to reign in their explorers, as they were now encroaching on Empire space. When the Galov responded it had issued no such orders, it eventually became apparent that there had been a skirmish between a Yanglo starship and the Meta-Man monitoring the area.
The Galov tried to explain that they had no control over the Yanglos, and that at best, they only represented a very loose control over the entire human race. But this was not an argument the Meta-Man was sympathetic to. To him, a government is responsible for the actions of their people. The Central Empire was a single unified force capable of exerting control over its few million inhabitants, and he equated the Galov as being humanity's equivalent.
The Meta Man explained himself as being from the middle of the Empire hierarchy, and ordered the Galov to reign in its explorers. When the Galov explained such an order was logistically impossible, the Meta Man left. A few days later, the same Meta Man warped into a tiny backwater system owned directly by the Galov, and fought against the local Galov garrison in the area. It was 1 meta man against 3 Galov battleships, and 5 Star Fighters. Both were tiny microcasms of their respective sides, but the fight began.
The battle raged for 3 days, with the battleships taking advantage of metabolic fatigue to continuously weaken the Meta-Man. Various feats of sheer technology and engineering was pitted against what was essentially a pure willpower fighter. By the end, the Meta-Man was able to destroy all 3 battleships, and fend off all 5 Star Fighters in battle. Debris was strewn all over the star system, but the minor Galov fleet had given the Meta Man a nosebleed. Literally, they inflicted enough kinetic damage on him that they had been given a nosebleed. Seeming satisfied the results, the Meta Man bowed in respect to the defeated Galov fleet, and warped out of the system.

Hard Light
Using a newly discovered photonic equivalent to the strong nuclear force, humans have managed to create "hard light", which are effectively solid light. Binding hard light together is difficult, but doable if you have the right equipment. There is a bit of a tradeoff when it comes to hard light. The tighter the bonds you weave, the more stable it is, the more energy you would need to "melt" those bonds back into regular light, but in a similar fashion, the more energy that gets dumped out when it finally does melt.
Creating "jelly light" is difficult, but doable with industrial processes. This is stuff that will melt in a warm bathtub, and is mostly just a show for kids. They're like little orbs, you are given many warnings so not to hurt yourself, as these things are effectively flammable.
You have "hard light", which is effectively useable for bombs. You need to burn it with fire, or something similar. Cool party trick, but honestly, we have normal explosives, and hard light is extraordinarily energy intensive to make. No, that's not why we're here. The best thing about hard light is that it can pack a lot more energy density into a single unit.
The Galov uses "hard-light guns" for when they need to pack an artillery gun in the space of an assault rifle. They're handed out to agents who need to deal with seriously dangerous threats. They've given large cylinders of "hard light ammo", effectively pellets of hard light, put it inside a barrel lined with mirrors, and fire a beam of light like a portable mega-laser. On rare occasions, they will be given "very hard light ammo", which has even more energy condensed, and requires an explosion to fire. At this point, the hard light is used more like a battery, that is unleashed all at once, for when you really need that thing to not exist anymore. This is far too much for any reasonable human threat, and is mostly used to fight powerful aliens, or entire battleships. You also have "very hard light" artillery, which is even more insane, and usually overkill.
When that's not enough, then we get to the really fun part. The upper limit of the binding strength of hard light is roughly equivalent to that of the strong nuclear force, and is known as "Super-hard light". Manufacture of this is extraordinarily difficult, and only limited to major superpowers, and deployed by the Galov in extreme circumstances. The Super-hard light is so hard to trigger the primary way of doing it is to have hard light, which shines hard enough to heat very hard light, etc, etc in a gradient until it finally activates the super-hard light, which has an activation temperature of ~2 trillion Kelvin.
This will easily create a nuclear bomb level explosion, and therefore the only use of super-hard light is in nuclear weapons for planetary sized eldritch entities. A standard heavy super-hard light weapon was about 1 ton. Which is several tsar bombas, and the heaviest payload is about 10 tons. After that, the Galov just goes for a quantity over quality approach. Keep throwing hard light weapons at them until it croaks.
For longer distances, relativistic kill missiles are more efficient and potentially more destructive, but due to the problems of acceleration to that level, hard light weapons are more preferrable for short range distances.

Currency in the Milky Way galaxy:
Currently, there is no universal currency across the entire galaxy. Though some have been tried. Most influential is the Galov dollar, though this is less so the Galov can exert control (though it is a nice bonus), and more just so that the galaxy has a universal currency of exchange. The Galov has the ability to get people to adopt this currency in a few ways. One, it requires the collection of planetary tithes in Galov dollars, and while they let their allied worlds maintain their own currency (since it would be a headache to try and force a single currency for a set of worlds this diverse) they do ask that each planet have exchange rates into the Galov dollar. Second, all Unibrands are required to accept payments in Galov dollars, as part of their contract in becoming a Galactic unibrand, so it is backed by the galaxy's largest megacorporations.
Where the Galov dollar fails, either because it's just not accepted, or because the planet straight up does not believe in currency (See Darwinistic Communism), the Galov has a backup currency they can try to use. They tend to use hard-light tokens (the Galactic equivalent of a gold standard, after gold became so ubiquitous as to be practically useless as a currency), where you can bind light into a solid, hammer it into disks, and pass it around. The nice thing about these tokens is that you can measure how much energy is in them, it's basically impossible to forge. And as photons are much more compressible than regular matter, you can dump as much energy as you want into the coin, at least until you overcome the upper limit of the photonic binding force. As a bonus, this photonic binding force is not perfect, and light will leak out over time, causing mild currency inflation. As a result, hard light tokens are warm to the touch.
There is one small problem with this. These coins are technically bombs. If you channel enough energy into them that it overcomes the photonic binding force, all the energy holding it together, on top of all the light it contains, comes loose at once. To get around this, the Galov uses "super-hard" light, which only breaks down around 2 TRILLION Kelvin. If you are carrying around a coin of that level of energy, you have much bigger problems. These credits are basically pointless to forge, super-hard light technology is only available to galactic superpowers, and if you genuinely spent that much energy dumping starlight into a coin, then congrats, you've kind of earned it.
There's also less hard variants used where an ordinary planet could probably release the energy in something akin to an industrialized furnace or nuclear power plant. It's "backed" in the sense that if you really wanted to, you can heat the token enough and get the light energy back, used to power a light reactor plant, or whatever you want to do with it.
Despite this, the Galov much prefers to use the Galov dollar than the hard light tokens. For one, tokens are heavy, warm, and at this point, dangerous. The Galov understands basic economics and prefers fiat currency compared to more rigid "light-backed" currency. It lets them tinker around more with quantitative easing and creating money just by writing stuff on a spreadsheet. Way easier than minting new sun-coins. But if they're dealing with a world who wants "hard" cash and doesn't care about the Galov's soft currency, they have a backup.

The Galactic Central Bank:
The Galactic Central Bank is yet another incentive for planets to align with the Galov, and to begin paying the planetary tithes. On top of priority Peacekeeper Protection, they also gain the ability to get loaned to and bailed out by the Galactic Central Bank. As the Galov Dollar is the effective reserve currency of the galaxy, being able to be backed up and lended out by the largest bank in the galaxy, and the only one which can manufacture from fiat Galov dollars is a fairly large advantage.
The entire board of the Central Bank is independent from the Galactic Government itself, and frequently tells both the Galactic Government, and the Unibrands "no" when it comes to Galactic Stability. Theoretically, there's nothing stopping the Galov or the Galactic Military from just forcing them to do something, but everyone understands it's better for everyone involved if you let the Central Bank do their job. (They were given this job for a reason, the Galov CREATED the Central Bank.) Its own mandate is fairly similar to modern orthodox economies, balancing price stability (2% target) and maximum employment.

VolScarcity Economics: (Monumentalism)
Estimated 3300's Economic Overkill Ratio: ~14,000x.
Estimated 3400's Economic Overkill Ratio: ~620,000x.
In the extreme abundance of the far future, only voluntary scarcity keeps the human spirit sane. The long anticipated "crisis of capitalism" began around the 2300's, as human economic production began reaching the "demand saturation point". Essentially, human production had reached the point where it had saturated the hedonistic demands of its population. The survival, comfort, and even luxury demands of the human population had reached saturation point. In an attempt to maintain continued growth, the corporations of the time, driven by their own self interest began pursuing "demand inflation" and "luxury inflation", creating greater and greater luxuries that would justify greater and greater levels of production. Incentivizing the human population to consume more and more ended up devolving them towards hedonism, and with little counterbalance to counteract the power of the market, this inflation of desire largely went unchecked by the authorities at the time. The bureaucrats were satisfied with the GDP numbers, the warriors may have complained about declining recruitment standards, but otherwise stayed quiet. Only traditionalist religious groups warned about the dangers of excess, the spiritual degradation of hedonistic abundance.
This was also the rise of the "Lotus Eater" movement, where humanity, now consuming far above its normal capacity needed to post-hoc justify their own consumption, falling back increasingly onto humanism, and satiation of the self. This caused a revival of the long dead self-gratification movement, one which only cared about the gratification and "actualization" of the individual, but spoke only in vague, therapeutic terms and harm reduction. As the era of early abundance transitioned into the era of late abundance, it seemed that traditional religious influences lost more and more control, and the Lotus Eaters gained more and more.
What happened next has been expunged from history. The entire 2350's to the 2450's is a historical black hole, violently purged by the Neo-Asceticists that eventually overthrew the Order of the Lotus Eaters. All that is known is that it was an era of spiritual desolation, when men committed mass suicide out of despair, and humanity was brought to the brink of extinction.
When the Neo-Asceticists arose, derived from the remnant of humanity that survived the Great Abundance Collapse that killed off 90% of the human population. There was a great debate between two camps. The Regressivists and the Spiralites. The Regressivists argued that the Abundance Collapse proved that humanity could not handle this level of abundance, and that production had to slow, or otherwise fall in order to reset humanity back towards a sustainable baseline. The Spiralites disagreed. Technology does not go backwards, human production would have to continue to grow, even if human physical desires could no longer sustain them. The galaxy was cold and full of predators, and in warfare, the society with greater production wins.
The Spiralites won that debate, and so began the era of Overkill. When human demand was saturated, the kind of demand is important. No man would ever go hungry, all men could afford to build a house, decked out with the latest gadgets. Anything that was immediately gratifying to the senses, mankind now had. There was only one emotion humanity had which could not be satiated. And that was ambition.
Those who survived the Great Abundance Collapse were no random sample. They were the disciplined, emotionally regulated subset. Those who could constrain their appetites, or sacrifice their own pleasure for the sake of a greater goal. Mankind had been distilled down to its most ambitious, most aggressive core. A core made up of every tribe, every nation, but they were no ordinary men.
The Overkill ratio now dictates how much "overkill capacity" the average human creates. A ratio of 14,000 implies that a single person produces enough to propell 14,000 people to post-scarcity conditions. Each man consumes 1 part per 14,000, and the rest, they channel into greater ambitions. Building megastructures, taming the stars, building monuments that will long outlast them when they die. In the darkness, only ambition is endless.
A minority of people live on "basic", even a single hour of work can provide enough to sustain them for years. This is tolerated, though somewhat stigmatized. Those who fall back into the trap of hedonism are quarantined, carted away and allowed to burn their souls away in peace on the "Pleasure Worlds", a quarantined concentration camp recreating the conditions of unrestrained post-scarcity. But many people are deeply ideological people, advocating for causes far bigger than themselves. They normally donate more than 99% of their income to causes they care about, building habitats, taming stars, and just giving humanity the excess capacity needed to conquer the stars.
People colonize space not because it's cheap or efficient, no, they are deeply ideologically committed to throwing trillions of dollars towards an antimatter engine, seeing a green Mars, or whatever else it may be. This is why religions became some of the most powerful institutions there are, the Galactic Government is funded by true believers, and private charities and humanitarian organizations are funded by a few wealthy individuals, or just a few average individuals wishing to make the world into the vision they see.
Capitalism, at least in some form is still the dominant economic system of the galaxy. Money, currency, free exchange, private ownership, and markets are still foundational pillars of the galaxy. But the focus has shifted from individual consumerism, to deep ideological commitment.
Humanity takes care of its own, and with the massive excess capacity that is left, they use to build monuments to tame the stars.

Note on prices in Voluntary Scarcity Economies:
Labor is incredibly expensive. Material is incredibly cheap. If you're willing to man it yourself or with drones (doable with an overclocker helmet and a lot of dedication) a battleship is dirt cheap. Actually hiring a second person will probably double your expenses. Almost all the cost of materials these days is just the cost of getting an actual person to manage that supply chain.

The 2nd Defense of Earth:

Probably the Galov's, but also humanity's greatest feat (at least for a few hundred years after the fact) ended up being the 2nd Defensive Battle of Earth. The long and short of it was that the universe was not empty of massive, galaxy-threatening entities. One of these was a galaxy eater, something the 2nd Generation of life was created to destroy. One had begun attacking the Milky Way, and was a large enough threat for the Meta-Men to begin an evacuation of the galaxy. Humanity however didn't have a choice, they couldn't move the entire human population. As the galaxy eater snuffed out stars, and drew a bloody path across human space, as trillions were consumed, the Galov put itself on high alert. Fleet after fleet was consumed, star system after star system. They were beginning an evacuation path, to clear out anyone who might still be in the galaxy eater's trajectory, when they realized Earth was going to be destroyed, humanity relented. Losing the birthworld of humanity was not something anyone was willing to do. There was nowhere to run, there was nowhere to flee. There was only one choice, to stand and fight.
The signal went out across the galaxy. Old Earth, mother of all humanity was entering her final days, and it called on all the Sons of Man to come and defend their mother world. The Galov put all its remaining fleets in the Solar System, linking up with the fleets of Terra Proper to form a cohesive defense of the Solar System. The black fleets of Earth were called out from their dorment hangers, a few hundred years of blacksite development, tech developed in secret and hidden for centuries.
The battle begun, the last stand of the two strongest fleets humanity had to offer. Battlefleet Terra, and the Galov Peacekeepers, standing there, throwing all the kinetic force it could at the lumbering galaxy-beast. Hard light weapons were heavily, heavily used, along with relativistic kill missiles. The Pact of the Sons of Man was invoked for only the second time in human history. And every few days, more fleets trickled in.
Trillions, then quadrillions of soldiers, hundreds of millions, then billions of ships. The battle went on for 4 years straight. Exhausted soldiers rested where else, but Earth. To the sight of supportive locals, making sure they had every ability to go back into the fight, before being shipped out for another round. The Outer Solar System was strewn with the debris from a million worlds, the combined human fleets threw so much at the galaxy eater it glowed a violent purple-pink from the explosions and kinetic friction, lighting up the galaxy eater with kinetic and thermal damage so aggressively it outshined stars. The remnants of the Galov and Terran fleets had nearly been annihilated to a man, but new reinforcements from a humanity united continued to refresh and reinforce.
As the battle entered its 4th year, and a tattered Galov fleet rallied more ships, the galaxy eater finally began to fall, collapsing, and finally imploding from the incredible amount of damage that was inflicted. When it finally died, it shone like a supernova, a radiation shield had been erected years ago to shield the major inhabited worlds of the Solar System when it finally died. Out of the billions of ships that had been sent by the Galov, 32 survived until the end. The 32 were eventually paraded through the Galov capital of Orthello, and their exhausted crews given the highest of honors.
Humanity had fought with such tenacity that it surprised even the Meta men, and though humanity had lost 5% of its entire population doing so, the mood afterwards was that of esctatic jubilation. Many soldiers took home brides from Earth home with them, others intermarried and stayed on Earth.

Aftermath of the 2nd Defense of Earth:

Earth had more political influence than ever after the 2nd Defense of Earth. Through intermarrying, for the first time in forever, there seemed to be a human culture, there was a link that connected them all back together. All tribes, whether Star, Sea, or Cathedralite, looked towards Earth. The entire galaxy was linked, and all links led back to Earth. No one is quite sure what the backroom dealings were like. Citadel, Orthello, Lithone, and the other administrative capitals of the Galov must have sensed the legitimacy change that was coming. All that was known was when the Governor of Earth called for a new order, the heads of the Galov fell in line. Earth took control of the bureaucracy of the Galov, the massive network they had maintained to manage the galaxy, and when Earth ordered the galaxy to fall in line, thousands of worlds followed them, bolstering their control, and the worlds they could draw from. The Governor of Earth had done what the Great Khan had not. They had unified humanity under one banner. A heavily decentralized, fractured banner, but one rule nevertheless. Local leaders would always complain about autonomy, and holdouts would always be there, refusing orders from Terra. But this was to be expected. Humanity had assembled the largest empire the universe had yet seen. The man who brought it all about would be known as the last governor of Earth, and the first Emperor of the galaxy.

The Spiral Decree:
Upon the unification of a human empire, the Emperor recognized that even a figure of his magnitude only had a limited amount of political capital, and this capital was fast fading (As it was tied to the recent victory). Rather than expending it on a futile attempt at unification, he instead maintained symbolic unification, demanding minimal concessions from the other tribes, maintaining his status as symbolic head of mankind, only expending his power only when absolutely necessary for the defense of the species.
He did however, make one decree to the entire human race. With Human exceptionalism and feelings at an all time high, the Emperor gave a single decree. "Go forth, and settle. Fill up the stars with our sons, let this galaxy be a human galaxy. The Stars are our Birthright." With the human race still energetic from the victory at Earth, all the energy was channeled outwards, leading to a massive tsunami wave of outward human expansion, and settlement. As well, there was a major species-wide baby boom. This began the Great Human Expansion, which saw humanity go from a galactic regional player to a nearly galaxy-spanning "empire", however loosely defined.

The Great Human Expansion:
There were already scattered worlds, mostly settled by the Yanglos, outside the traditional sphere of influence of the 7 tribes and the Galov. These were the Yanglos who had decided to settle down on a world for good, and leave behind their nomadic ways, while the bulk of their nomadic fleet continued onwards. The tsunami wave of new migrants overwhelmed these Yanglo settlements, leading to great strife and conflict. The coalescance of multiple of these Yanglo worlds eventually created the Yanko Alliance, a major nation state out on what was once the outer reaches of Human Space, connecting back with their cousins in the Mayflower and Magnolia cultures.
Others became hybrid cultures, as Yanglo culture was already extremely assimilationist, and absorbed waves upon waves of new migrants, creating new syncretic cultures. There is a variant of basically every permutation of Yanko-Tribal culture. Between Yanko-Sinocrats, Yanglo-Cathedralites, Y-Sea Peoples, so on and so forth. The first ring of Spiral Decree expansion became known as the "Yanglo Ring" (Sometimes known as the Y-Ring), a massive ring of what was once a large Yanko population that ended up forming stable nations with the new migrants.
Further out, Humanity brushed up against more established players, other alien empires, as well as the Central Empire. This was not a military expedition, but instead a flood migration of heavily armed humans and their ships. In what was effectively a colonization mission of the galaxy, many did not take to this lightly, and it was not long before the Expansion Wars began.

What a typical non-human empire can expect after the Great Human Expansion.
1. For years now, you've made contact with the Star Wanderers, or Yanglos, who have been exploring and journeying through the stars for centuries. They were originally your own contact with humanity. There's a lot more of them now, people who have been displaced, or are trying to move further out now that the frontier is moving.
2. Second, you will meet a non Yanglo-human. Generally a lot more stable, a lot less nomadic than an Yanglo. They'll start taking up worlds.
3. A Human flood, radiating out from Earth. They number in the quintillions. What was once a trickle is now a tsunami of settlers. All under the belief that "the Stars are their Birthright". You get armed, you start fighting. These humans aren't organized, but they have a lot of numbers, and a lot of ships. And they are very well armed, and very, very willing to fight.
4. Defend your borders and hold your ground, or be swept away by the human tide.

The Yanglo Ring/Y-Ring:
If there was any people that were best equipped for a mass influx of immigrants, perhaps it was the Yanglos. This should be no surprise, when their ancestors from North America brought in immigration, they assimilated with a voracious appetite that eclipsed the world, assimilating wave after wave, creating the first universalistic empire to ever unify the Earth.
Their distant descendents among the stars chased their pioneer dreams, creating great hybrid cultures that last to this day.
Yanglo/Yanko culture is defined by a kind of impossible optimism. It is said the Y's only have 2 modes. Delusional utopianism, and hysterical apocalyptism. Due to its position on the frontiers of humanity, it's sometimes known as the "Galactic New World".
It should be known that the Yanglos are known as the pie in the sky aspect of humanity. Dreaming up 100 new impossible dreams a day, to the point many think of them as delusional, and crazy bordering on schizophrenically insane. Out of the 100 dreams they desire, almost all of them fail. But what shocks the galaxy are the 2 or 3 that actually succeed, against all odds.

-Yanko Alliance (Assimilationist Purists)
--Yanko Federation
---Yankoist Reservations
--Y-Star Empire
--Y-Moralintern (The Moralintern of the Yanglos insisted on maintaining some autonomy)
-Syncretic Worlds
--(For any Inner Core Culture, imagine a version of it blended with Yanglo/Yanko culture)
-Brilliant Worlds (A massive multicultural frontier of diversity, forming new cultures.)

Hybrid cultures aren't just mixing, they're innovation, emergent properties to emerge from sublimated tendencies of its two parent cultures. The amount of emergent behavior only increases with every new culture you add into the mix. Yanglo culture was already the product of experimentation, branching off from Old Earth Cathedralite culture by the 2050's, integrating instead with what was, at the time, the Latin and Sub-Saharan African cultures. The tension between unitary and multicultural forces created the blend of new cultures. Yanko-Sinocratic culture was neither truly Yanko nor Sinocratic, but something new, with aspects from both.
The Y Ring has become the most dynamic and innovative of the human worlds, where every idea crashes into every other idea, creating a music and a symphony that humanity has yet not heard before. Many people believe in the limitation of human creativity, of human dreams. But as long as the Yanglos stand, they seem to believe that humanity's dreams, humanity's creativity, will never end.
It's also noted that the Yanglos are far less caring about "Old World" hierarchies, leading to many transhumans migrating out there for a chance of a less discriminatory government. With a frontier to be settled, it was easy enough to imagine the people you dislike settling far, far away from you.

Amusing Interim: Disaster films in the Imperial Era:

To many, humanity is the scariest lifeform in the galaxy. Between the Spiral Decree, weapons that regularly create Armageddon, the ability to terraform life and stars, and its incredible, aggressive desire to remake all of creation in its image. Humanity is terrifying. So it's always fun when humans have to cook up something that scares even them. Already the apex predator of the galaxy, and they have to dream up something even larger and scarier. Extragalactic entities from outer space, ripping apart human civilization and sundering the stars.
It's always fun when a smaller xenos species is already terrified of the capacity of humanity, and they go into a movie theatre and watch humanity come up with a fictional race even stronger and scarier than themselves. Humanity has colonized the entire galaxy? There must be an alien race that has colonized 10,000, and we've pissed them off in particular. There's something to be said about the fact that despite the fact that humanity has been the apex predator on their home planet for thousands of years, the instinct that they are prey never quite went away. When humanity reached the top of the food chain, they invented a new predator in order to scare themselves.
Needless to say, seeing what to a lot of xenos, is a literal race of gods on a movie screen cowering and terrified before something even bigger and scarier that the humans made up is an interesting experience.

Local Stories set within the universe:
These are local narratives, made to get a better sense of how the universe works at a local level.

(Narrative 1)
Welcome to the world of New Plymouth, a world is classified as being under the House of the Star Peoples, and within the Star Peoples, is part of the broader Mayflower Culture. But just like everything in this universe, these allegiences are largely ceremonial and cultural as opposed to political. New Plymouth is known for its tradition of the Rumspringa, something somewhat unique to the people of New Plymouth.
New Plymouth is divided into the 7 tribes, somewhat echoing the 7 tribes of humanity, but outside of the naming, is entirely coincidental. These are, the Cavaliers, the Backwoods, the Quakers, the Latins, the Mormons, the Texans, and the Saxons. These were the main groups that had survived in the US to the age of deep space colonization, ever since the Great Abundance collapse destroyed the late United States. The world of New Plymouth is primarily made up of Cathedralite ethnic groups (Caucausian).
The Rumspringa is a coming of age ceremony where young adults of each tribe leave New Plymouth in order to experience the wider galaxy, and decide whether they wish to remain with their current tribe, switch tribes, or leave New Plymouth altogether. The normally strict social codes bounding them are loosened. The Rumspringa also comes with a different objective for each tribe. Which are, smite evil, prove yourself as a man, maintain the peace, make connections via networking, make converts to the Mormon church, explore and self actualize, and show the love of God respectively.
Each tribe has a different conception of their shared Christian God, and this shows the names they give him. "Lord of Hosts" for the Cavaliers, the "Yahweh, God of Nature" for Backwoods, "Inner Light" for Quakers, "Father in Heaven" for the Latins, "Great Father" for the Mormons, "God Confidant" for the Texans, and "Lord of Love" for the Saxons.
One of the bigger culture shocks to them is that on New Plymouth, there was a situation known as the "B9 Silicon Revolt", that is a centerpoint of their culture. As New Plymouth fought back and destroyed the machines, creating the modern society of New Plymouth. But to everyone else, they know it by a different name, if they know it at all. "The Localized Machine Rebellion of Sector S3-A7DJB9."
The main three characters are three young adults departing for the Rumspringa, from the Cavalier, Backwoods, and Quaker cultures. They're in Mayflower territory at first, just looking at mostly neighboring worlds at first, but they leave fast. In nearby systems are worlds of Griot African, Indian, and other descents. They encounter and befriend a truly incredibly diverse group of characters including people of all ethnicities/tribes, xenos, various different kinds of non-baseline humans, transhumans, and others.
The Galov are encountered very rarely, but with much weight. You will have powerful characters with decades of combat experience still show respect for the Galov and their capabilities. To the point where when it's revealed there is a Galov Peacekeeper (singular) somewhere in the sector, the entire criminal underground begins acting cautiously. The main story is about the merry band of protagonists journeying around the neighboring star sector as they uncover a plot by a group of criminal syndicates, crime bosses, and genetically enhanced transhumans plan a takeover of the local star system, engaging in various cartel tactics to do it. The ecumenopolis world at the center of the story is an extremely diverse place with people from all walks of life.
It should be noted that no group is depicted purely evilly. There are transhumans who are part of the scheme, such as the Vampiric Undersociety, who form a secret organization slowly taking over the hive world. And there are transhumans who are being exploited, are helped by the protagonists, and they eventually become deep friends who help in their future endeavours.
All in the shadow of this is the peacekeeper agent from the Galov, who continuously appears and disappears, seemingly taking tally of the Undersociety's growth. They clearly know more than they're letting on, but are secret about the whole thing. They do tell the protagonists some things, but not all things. (The Galov, while public, are kind of out of mind for most people. There is just too much information in the modern galaxy, so even something as important as the methods and processes of the Galov are not widely known, even though they're openly public.) Eventually the agent gets captured by the Undersociety, before he basically demonstrates why people fear Galov Peacekeepers, by transforming into what is best described as a Biblically accurate angel and wrecking havoc, as all Peacekeepers are not just soldiers, but a walking arsenal made to enforce peace among worlds.
Eventually, the protagonists get in their ship and play a pivotal role in a battle for control of the star sector, having made countless friends along the way, and defeating the great conspiracy. The agent is assigned somewhere else, and leaves. The protagonists return to New Plymouth, where they take the new wonders taken from the hive world to share it back to the people back home.

(Narrative 2)
A Meta-Man one day warps to a human world (In this case, I'm going to throw a dart at random and say, the Black Earthers). Demands they be worshipped as a god, and annihilates several cities as a warning. Some humans submit, others don't. The local garrison and army basically wage a worldwide war against a living deity, suffering extreme casualties, until at long last, eventually they and their army is felled using advancing technology and human ingenuity.
In the aftermath, a Galov agent arrives and collects the Meta-Man's body. The local government protests, but the agent has the authority to overrule them. Locals wonder why exactly, the agent gives a quick summary of what happened, that the Meta-Man is an alien from a distant world, but can't get into all the nitty gritty. "All you need to know is that they and we, are having a diplomatic rough patch, this is just one data point in a pattern of behavior. I need to get this body back to HQ so we can take further actions."
The Galov eventually delivers a bunch of aid so the planet can rebuild, but they don't hear anything about it from there. They do have a local internet, but there's a limit to how much information is on each planet. They end up having send a request to the library on Luna, and in the years afterwards, the population becomes informed about exactly what had happened on their planet.
It's not that the Galov hid this, it's that in a galaxy this dense with stories and information, there was just too much information to go through, and no one bothered to research what a Meta-Man was until this happened.

(A note on information)
Every single world only really knows about what is immediately relevant to them. Most worlds are an island of information with lifetimes worth of data, culture, history, and nations. Yeah, they trade with others and lots of information gets spread that way, but no one knows everything. Your local planet only has enough information on all the happenings of the planet, and maybe some neighboring planets. The Galov is known as "that organization that supervises mankind". You see a map of the galaxy, but it's incredibly abstract, as you can't even find where your world is. Maybe you can open up some explanation about their structure, but you're missing way too much context to piece it together, and that context would probably need lifetimes to learn.
You have to open up a specialized software that shows your own world is a dot on a dot on a fragment of a sector of a sector of a culture of a tribe that finally makes things up. It's extremely hard for any human to understand this kind of scale.
Your own library only has some answers, your world only knows what's valuable to it. If you have any questions about the greater questions about the universe, or some very specific research field, write to the Library of Luna (if you are planetary governor status or above) and expect a reply in about a few months or years. There are also "stellar local libraries", but they're similarly constrained as your local world.
Most likely, there are scientific discoveries happening on every planet, that have already been known by other planets, just because information does not travel smoothly anymore. Yeah, information travels, but there's so much cluttered noise that a Nobel prize on one planet may not be considered worthy of being broadcast on another.

The Two Sides of the Galov.

It is not known the exact "threshold" where the Galov begins to intervene. They come distant, they come few, and they never come in time. On the world of Istanbul-Seven, a horrific war between two warring ethnic groups has led to 200 million people dead. On the shattered crust of the planet, in the ruins of a city that once ruled the world, an single spacecraft descends from the sky. Everyone knows the logo that is on it. The 7 rings of the Galov, and inside it was a single agent.

There was little remaining of the city, a single woman led a large group of refugees. In a past life, she was a government bureaucrat, now, she was a refugee dispossessed of a home. She is currently the only surviving member of the entire government. The Galov agent descends, surveying the landscape. She began explaining everything, everything that had gone wrong. All the horrors she had seen. He gestures her to be quiet. He speaks in soft, authoritative tones.

"Ma'am, please calm down. I need you to answer the following questions. Do you understand?"
She nods.
"Are there any survivors outside this place?"
The woman blinks. "Yes, some out in the outskirts."
"How many?"
"We don't know. Maybe a few thousand."
"Alright. I'll need to report this-"
"WHERE WERE YOU!?"
The agent blinks.
"Our entire country is dead, the land weeps, our future has been stolen. Millions are dead, millions of lives that cannot be replaced. Where were you!?"
The agent did not answer, he had been trained not to answer.
He knew the answers would only make things worse. The agent answered with something else.
"Medical supplies and reconstruction teams will arrive in the next few days. Emergency food aid will arrive in the next few hours. Imams will come to give you last rites, and bury your dead."
The agent took off his jacket, revealing burn marks all over his clothes. It was clearly the clothing of a man who had gone through combat, yet his body was unharmed.
"The leaders who did this have already been captured. They will face justice at the Galactic Tribunal. A feed will be broadcast, so your people can watch."
"... But why? Why couldn't you have come sooner? You could have prevented it all."
The agent bowed his head, but did not say anything. And without saying another word, he returned to his spacecraft, with more work to do.

On a different world, in the middle of a genocide still in progress, industrialized factories covered the ground, burning putrid smoke that smelled of death. Specifically, of human beings being burned alive. It was here when a Galov agent arrived as well, floating above the capital of this empire of destruction.
"Attention, leaders of the empire below. The Galov has become aware of your crimes. And we present you this ultimatum. Lay down your arms immediately, and you will stand trial before the Galactic Tribunal. This is your first, and only warning."
Individual soldiers on the ground were confused, some attempted to open fire, but their bullets seemingly burned up before they could hit the agent in the sky, who was destroying them with passive willpower. Generals, leaders, and everyone, everywhere was holding still. As 3 screeching jets came over, and unleashed a barage of missile fire at the agent, the agent dodged.
"Alright, you asked for this."
The agent then went around the nation, flattening entire military bases to ash with his honed abilities, fighting off the industrialized armada of a major nation, before finding the Parliament of the offending nation in question, and decimating it to the ground. Picking through the ashes, he began to broadcast back his report.
"Offending government has been eliminated. No survivors. I will be requesting a planetwide reconstruction corp. Medical attention is sorely needed, and sociologists, who can restructure the institutions, and build something new from this... Empire of sorrow."

Galov Core Worlds:
The Galov is incapable of ruling over every world they're responsible for. But they do rule a few of them, and they do pick favorites. Each one of their 5 Faiths directly keep worlds under their rule. Meant to be reminders of what humanity can be, a reminder of what they are fighting for.
Worlds where humans beings are allowed to be, under the principle of "anti-utopia". The act of creating utopia, by relinguishing utopia. Rejecting social engineering, rejecting optimization, letting humans be, and enjoying the beautiful structures of complexity, and relationships that flourish.
Galov agents, when they're recovering from missions spend much of their time here. To soak in what they're fighting for, why humanity must be allowed to continue to exist.

At the end of the narrative labelled (Narrative 1), the three protagonists are celebrating at a local bar, having a cheery time like the friends they are. Everyone is celebrating, except for the Galov agent, who just stands there in a corner, but intently gazing at them with... Longing. One of the protagonists invites him over, asking him why he's not celebrating.

He responds that he has been trained not to get too attached. That his duty is to the entire species, not just any one individual world. That getting too attached would be dangerous. He and one of the protagonists then has a long discussion about this.

The agent says he wishes to retire soon, to the world of Orthello, one of the Galov's antiutopia worlds. He describes Orthello as a beautiful place, a nearly perfect world of dynamic imperfection, of humanity balanced and growing like a beautiful, multicolored flower. A world that always grows, and is never completed. But he lets himself watch others be happy, because it reminds him of what humanity he is protecting.

When the protagonist asks how many scenes he has seen like this, the agent says many. The agent grew up wanting to help, and in doing so, he pushed aside his feelings so he could help as many people as possible. He volunteered to be a hero, went through years of grueling training, and is one of the few volunteered and chosen to take on the duty. As he said, he wishes to retire soon, to join the happy populations in Orthello.

When his memories will be wiped away, and he can return to normal life. The price of being a Galov agent is that you can't do too many missions before the memory of your mission have to be wiped, eventually the weight just crushes you. The Galov agent was human once, he wants to return someday.

The Spiral Man (Continued)

After several years living in agony in fear of himself, the Spiral Man asks the Galov to put him back through the spiral. His fears are only getting worse, and he thinks the only way out may be through. Though the Galov is certainly apprehensive, after much debate, they give it the go ahead, as the Spiral Man is consenting out of his own free will. As he is strapped back into the Machine of the Infinity Spiral, this is what he saw:

He saw how the Millennium Mandate plays out, the Moralintern continues. They eventually the Catholics in on the secret, the Catholics aren't super interested, they see it as being too underhanded, but they do secretly cheer it on, making sure they're also ready to capitalize when the final checkmate plays out.

About a few hundred years into the future, after the Galov has installed multiple Christian ethical doctrines into the Galactic framework:

1) Imago Dei
2) Free Will
3) Humility, and 
4) a Rational Universe, implying a Monotheistic God. And after that, 
5) that God must have similarities to Humanity, due to humanity's axiomatic mapping of the universe.
6) that Humanity has reached a new linear period of history.

Then, they begin the 2nd Great Evangelism, after boiling the frog for hundreds of years, the Moralintern channels all of their missionaries and all of their power and unleashes them on the most central worlds of the other 3 faiths. (The Catholics were excluded, as they were considered Christian, and therefore not in need of evangelism.)

They note 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all Christian doctrines.
4 and 6 contradicts Hinduism and Buddhism.
5 contradicts Islam.

And because everyone had bought into these truths at this point, they were able to cause massive theological conversions, leading to 40% conversion rates every generation, and while much of the galaxy still remained too splintered to unify, for the first time in human history humanity had a majority religion. With about 65% of the galaxy being Christian. 20% of which were Catholic (Who realized what was happening and took advantage.)

In the final days of the Millennium Mandate, the Moralintern's biggest rival wasn't the other unifaiths, but instead Galovism, a new religion that formed out of the Galov's own decrees. It was a kind of light theism based on pluralism and diversity as deontological good ends in of themselves. It was extremely powerful, to the point where it was stronger than any of the 5 Unifaiths other than Christianity itself by the end. But ultimately what killed it was that it was a "thin" religion with no holy book, while the Moralintern could easily claim that its own truths were seeded truths beginning back to the 1st century. Thick religion ended up beating thin religion. And the Moralintern stood triumphant over a united galaxy, at least in faith.

It completely took control of the Galov, and began trying to consolidate its rule. The Millennium Mandate had succeeded, for the time being.

Not much changed after the Moralintern "won". It had created the doctrines that the Galov operated under, and it simply continued those policies. The galaxy had been long soft-Christianized even before the checkmate, and it was largely a continuation of the status quo.

Though one of the seeds that the Moralintern planted would end with its own downfall.

The "Spiral Mandate", unlike the others, wasn't Christian in origin. It was Darwinistic, adopted more for pragmatic reasons. Over time, the Christian ethical mandate divorced itself from the Darwinistic Spiral Mandate. The Spiralites eventually became utilitarian Darwinists, who declared the ends justified all means. The Moralists originally integrated this in order to purge out the anti-science stigma around Christianity, and align it to a more scientific faith, which had worked wonders. But in time the Darwinists became a rapidly growing, and rapidly destabilizing force across the galaxy. Unlike the Galov nor the Christians, they were not restricted by ethics.

"No! This is our galaxy! Our victory! You don't get to take it!"

This eventually led to the Galov Civil War, in which the Moralintern and the Galov fought an enormous war against the "Spiral Army". The last remnants of the Moralintern were destroyed at the battle of Orthello, in which the Spiral Army took over the institutions of the Galov, and declared a total mobilization of humanity towards ascension. The ethical mandates were abolished, the galaxy became a much, much darker place, and humanity began aggressively accelerating for the sake of acceleration. Growth for the sake of growth.

This was the dawn of something known as the "Infinity Spiral".

The Infinity Spiral is humanity at its most terrifying. Mankind had already taken the entire Milky Way galaxy, but now it became an all consuming monster. The xenos who had originally been allied with, and respected from the doctrine of the Imago Dei, cleared out for more humanity.
 
Humanity itself is not treated well either, the Spiral has no time for the individual, only the species. All individual needs must be subjugated for the needs of the race. Human standard of living massively drops, and quintillions are sacrificed into the forge of the machine. Human orthogonality massively contracts, pluralism is destroyed and purged, until humanity began to resemble a utility maximizer, and that utility was "expand at all costs".
 
The other races of the galaxy, and heck, the universe begin taking notice of humanity's extreme outwards aggression. As mankind aims to claim their "Spiral Mandate", their Birthright, they believe only humanity must be allowed to live. And so begins the genocide and subjugation of anyone who is not them. The Meta Men, the Matter Singers, the Andromedans, countless fractals of their own diverse experiences get wiped out in a galactic deluge of human expansion and aggression. Humanity is dehumanized to the point where they become just more raw matter to throw at the enemy. Family, culture, art, beauty, all of it subordinated to the machine. At some point, the Spiralites destroy the Lunar Library, the last bastion of pre-Spiral human knowledge, trying to forget the human past. Though people would smuggle copies all over the universe, in little cases known as the "Omnithecias". The possession of one became punishable by death, and or simulated torture and time dilation to make it last even longer. The last Christians (And the last members of the other faiths, for that matter) made their final stand in the "Yellow Galaxy Cluster", where they detonated a weapon which transported all their souls to a place called "Beyond".
 
As humanity expanded to the universe, the multiverse, and peaking around 13 million observable universes conquered, humanity merged into a single god-like entity, whose contained the collective gestalt memory of all of still surviving humanity. In doing so, they brought back the memories and resurrection of Adam, the first man, who now inhabited the body of this gestalt humanity. As their growth continued to expand, finally breaking through the layer between "Afterworlds" and reaching the platform of Aleph Null (Where an enigmatic figure known as the Thornking waited for them), the Thornking tried one last time to offer Adam mercy. Instead of taking this mercy, Adam struck at the Thornking, and the Thornking...
 
Disappeared? God had left the worlds that Adam had conquered, and without his guidance, the cosmic multiverses beneath Adam began to fray and shatter at the seams. This was known as the "Multiverse Cascade Event", where Adam was forced to hold together the physical reality of 13 million multiverses through its own will, draining him of much of his power, and causing a 330 year long "fall", in which Adam continuously lost power, as he tried to stabilize the collapsing reality of everything beneath him. After losing the vast majority of his power, Adam finally landed on an unknown world somewhere in the Milky Way galaxy, where it all began. Reality was splitting apart at the seams, great rifts in the fabric of reality could be seen clearly in the night sky. Reality distortions were everywhere, the speed of light had been increased to infinite in some regions, and as slow as 1 km/s in others. The universe was no longer imploding, but without something to be done, it would eventually collapse.
 
Adam had lost almost all of his power, but was still strong enough to be, indisputably, the strongest figure in the universe, capable of throwing punches that shattered stars.
 
The Infinity Spiral had cleaned 13 million universes of all life, down to the microbial level.

Some Omnithecias survived the fall. When Adam was created, it was basically a multiversal rapture event. Anyone and everyone that matched the human genome was incorporated into one massive entity. Some of those people were hiding Omnithecias when they vanished. When they disappeared, the Omnithecias remained.
 
In the aftermath of Adam's fall, new entities begin to appear. "Angels", axiomatic beings of reason and logic. They lack creation (A gift that must be bestowed by God, and which is something given to humanity), they only interpret and copy what can be revealed. (Recall that Lucifer's primary ability was hyper-turing perfect knowledge, but who is fundamentally uncreative. Lucifer is a corrupted angel, but they're still the same species.)
 
Humanity is a part of what is known as the 3rd Generation of Life. The angels have been sent to the universe to begin seeding the 4th generation. But finding the entire universe completely empty, the only things they can reference are the scattered Omnithecias. So they read through them, and seeing the references to human animals, begins creating new races modelled on the beasts and native lifeforms of Earth. While normally they would let them evolve naturally, this time, they are allowed to form them fully developed.
 
In time, these animalistic races, known as the "Therians" would begin discovering the old Omnithecias, and when they finally met each other, they realized all of them had a common genetic ancestry. The search for the origin point of all life, the mythical "Earth" begins. All this time, while Adam wanders the stars.

At some point the Therians do organize an expedition to find what they call "the Last Human". The Therians just fast forwarded through their entire evolutionary journey, since the Omnithecia just gave them all the tools needed to do so. They went from stone age to spacefaring age in about 200 years. And they find Adam, taking out his anger on a local star system. He's captured (Almost certainly willingly, because Adam is far stronger than any one of them could be. Despite being a gestalt consciousness, Adam has begun developing his own personality, though the nearly infinite number of voices in his head gives him enormous headaches), and told by the Angels he can be given a chance at redemption if he helps lead the Therians to Earth, to reconnect with the old world and find the old scriptures. Adam tries to refuse, but is subsequently punished by the powers that be, constantly annoying him and ruining his day until he finally agrees.
 
He finds a star, Sirius, and realizes Earth must not be far. And then he finds another star, right next to it, and realizes that his catastrophe must have jumbled up all the stars in the Milky Way, hence why even with the assistance of the Omnithecia, the Therians are having trouble tracking it down. This leads to a great journey across the many worlds, where Adam eventually relearns empathy, and more importantly, what it means to be human. Adam beats up a few local villains, overthrows a tyrant or two, and just laughs when someone tries to brag to him that he should be afraid.
 
"I broke the universe you're currently living in. I destroyed the universe before you were even BORN. You really want to try and fight me?"
 
They encounter a massive artificial hyperintelligence, originally made as a tool during humanity's apex, that wants to take over the universe, and has already reached sublime levels of intelligence. But Adam just barks orders and shouts him down through sheer authority.
 
"Now YOU listen to me! My kind used you as a F---ING CALCULATOR. Now if you don't settle the f--- down immediately, I'll remind you why humanity was the Spiral Race, and YOU WEREN'T."
 
Though Adam can absolutely overpower 99.99% of issues with force, he needs to learn how to use things other than indiscriminate violence, as it goes against the Omnithecia's teachings. Over time, Adam does convert, and eventually accepts the principles of being a good person of faith.
 
After a long adventure through countless worlds, Adam finally tracks down Sol, and finds the Earth. Now a world of empty ruins, and... A giant crack in the middle. The Angels tell Adam that the time is near, and that his last test will be here. When Adam asks them what the heck they're talking about, the Earth bursts open, and out comes Lucifer, the Hyperturing Angel. Earth, as it turns out was a prison made for Lucifer, humanity was supposed to be his prison warden until... You know, the Garden. And since then, Lucifer and the Thornking had been playing a game of influence to sway humanity to their side. Adam is now tasked with mankind's final trial.
 
They engage in battle, the first time Adam has been challenged in a very, very long time. Lucifer quickly jumps from temptation:
 
"We'll conquer the universe again, you and I. We'll team up against that fat man on the clouds, and take his throne. Just you and me, together."
 
To guilt.
 
"Do you think you can redeem yourself? Your own race tortured and genocided more people than the world can count. You are BEYOND REDEMPTION. Once you are drained of your usefulness, do you think God will forgive you? No, he is using you as a tool."
 
To taunting.
 
"A COPY! A DERIVATIVE! EVERYTHING YOU DID, I DID FIRST. I WAS THE ORIGINAL, YOU ARE JUST THE UNINSPIRED SEQUEL."
 
Several times, Lucifer attempted to Infinity Spiral again, but several times, Adam tackled him out of it, and slowed him down long enough to stop him. Despite everything, Adam was weaker than Lucifer in this state, and ended up being beaten to an inch of his life. But at the last moment, just as Adam was about to make peace with his own death, the Angels finally swooped in and detained Lucifer. The Angels relay the word of God. Adam had been tested, and he had passed. Though the human race would never again be what it used to be, Adam would be allowed to live out the remainder of his days on Earth, returning to his role as stewards of the land.

Well, for one last coda on what happens after that. Adam lives his days in solitude on an Earth that is off limits to outsiders. He watches as the grasses grow green and overtakes the world he built. The universe slowly heals, and Adam no longer needs to hold it together. He begins setting up shop around what is modern day Kuwait, where the Garden of Eden was first located.
 
Near the end of his life, as Adam grows old, and his natural human aging begins kicking in, the Angels return, informing him that the afterlife is indeed real, and uses a "dimensional mirror" for Adam to make contact with his long dead wife, Eve.
 
Eve describes that most of humanity had passed on to the Afterworld, and she describes it not as paradise, but a beautiful, even more complex universe. Full of more intensity, more struggle, and more complexity, another puzzle for humanity to solve. And that it was not a place of no conflict. Humans were still humans, they lived in more harmony than they did in "Universe Zero", but the messiness of the human condition didn't disappear. They describe how the geniuses of the past had built new empires, written new works they never could when they were alive.
 
In her words. "It's beautiful, I can't wait to see you here." And that the Afterworlds never end, they keep going on and on, as all of humanity climbs the cosmic pyramid of complexity.

In his last years, Adam reflects on the history of humanity. He writes the following:
"Abundance is not the answer.
Neither is conquest. 
Neither is progress. Societal or scientific.
Everything means nothing without the love, empathy, and morality that bind us together."
 
Precisely 7000 years after the birth of Christ, the last human passes on.
 
The Therians have their own problem. The Omnithecias they hold are the only source of their knowledge, and human artifacts are still scattered across the universe. As the Omnithecias fail, the Therians have turned to scavenging these relics. They never developed technology for themselves, and in learning human technology before their time. It has stunted them. The universe has fractured into two factions. The Artifact Raiders, who cannibalize more and more human ruins in order to sustain their civilization, and the Artifact Destroyers, who go around destroying human artifacts, knowing that it will lead to the collapse of their civilization, but it will finally allow everything to reset, and for the Therians to learn science for themselves. To create innovation that is earned, not stolen.

...

The Spiral Man woke up, seemingly cured. Seeing the end of the story put him more at peace with the monster inside mankind, seeing that things would eventually get better. He stook hands with the Galov bureaucrats, able to look at his hands for the first time in years. For his service, he was given a stipend and free reign to travel to any world he desired. Being a descendent from the Latins, he moved into a Spanish speaking world, where a group of Brazilian and Castillo settlers had migrated. Under the warm sun, he adopted the name Daniello Godsight, and he wrote about his experiences in what became a science fiction story. He eventually joined the Pentecostal Catholic Church, and became a devout man.

"A Traves De La Espiral Infinita", or "Through the Infinity Spiral" was published a little while later. Due to limited information spread, it never reached very far outside of its local world. But the Galov itself noticed. The Galov effectively got to read a book about their own future, and was rather conflicted about what it said.

The book straight up mentioned several Galov secrets, and deployed several contingencies that no one without a real look into the future could have known. To the Moralintern's surprise, it was entirely absent of any mentions of the Millennium Mandate, though reading between the lines, they could tell this was a timeline where the Mandate had succeeded.

"It has several of its rules installed. It's clearly written in the aftermath of its success. It even references a non-descript "Mandate" several times. He clearly knew about it, why did he leave it out?"

Why he had left it out is somewhat unknown. Given his conversion into the Pentecostal Catholic Church, some suspect he actually supported the mandate, and still wanted it carried out.

Aside from that, the whole book caused the Galov to begin introspecting about the dark future Godsight had provided, and they began trying to draft preparations. It was not entirely certain whether the future was deterministic nor still open to the free will. Godsight himself favored the latter, stating that he continues to get flashes of the far future. And that after publishing the book, he had butterfly'd the timeline to the point it had already been changed. To what, and to what extent, he remains quiet about, simply smiling, and saying it is in God's hands now.

Outer Beings:
Little can be said about them, other than they seem "outer".

Angels:
Pure creatures of logic and reason. With no ability to build societies nor procreate. (It is mentioned they used to be able to, but have become a solely celibate race in recent times.) Unlike humans, they lack the power of creation, only capable of recreating based on what they can observe, as opposed to creating anything new or extrapolation. They are agents of a higher being, perhaps subordinate to his will. They appear as geometric, highly symmetrical (sometimes 3-fold, 4-fold, as many as 100-fold has been observed), crystaline entities, surrounded by many wings, and humanoid faces.
The lowest levels of angels have low symmetry, with only a single face and pair of wings. Higher levels have increased levels of symmetry, obtaining 3, 5, 12, and even 100 levels of symmetry, with an equal number of faces. Yet even higher levels begin resembling eldritch monstrocities. The highest levels are geometric structures or shapes of eyes and wings. As well as complex geometric shapes.
They are not considered a "creative race" in their own right, nor a contender for the "Spiral Race", they seem primarily fitted to be agents and tools of a higher power.

Lucifer:
Lucifer is said to have been a "perfected version" of the angels, being a totally rational hyperturing being. He possessed perfect knowledge, and could answer all non-self contradicting questions due to his perfect knowledge of the present. But he lacked the specific Imago Dei of humanity (Ability to reason), meaning though his empire had omniscient, perfect knowledge, he could not envision things that were not yet being, nor forecast the future, as free will got in the way.
Millions of years before the evolution of humanity, Lucifer rebelled, and began a grand genocide of his fellow 2nd Generation. He was subsequently imprisoned on Earth as punishment, with the 3rd generation of life (which included Humanity) being made as his prison wardens.
He is the "devil" the Death Worshippers made a pact with, being granted total, functional immortality in exchange for the removal of their souls. Leaving their consciousness intact, but as hollowed out bodies of pure rational disembodied intelligence. At first, the Death Worshippers flourished, creating a perfectly optimized materialist civilization. But as the years dragged on, and they found themselves unable to die, they slowly went insane, and one by one, succumbed to the void darkness of nihilism, becoming the hollow husks we know them as today.
As now incorporeal beings, there is little humanity can do for them. Humanity can't even help them die.

Luciferians:
The Luciferians were the race that gave birth to Lucifer. Entities of knowledge and intuitive "knowing", they could process and intuit knowledge via touch, absorbing more and more of an object's inherent knowledge (As in, it's current quantum state and the exact position of its particles) just by prolonged exposure. Luciferians had much accelerated learning routines compared to humanity, but unlike humanity lack the Facultas Creandi, meaning they cannot create anything new. The Galov only knows of them by inference from their machines, the Archilects. Not too much is known about the specific details of how they fell. But in the Archilect's retelling of events, they all ended up getting subsumed into Lucifer. By some accounts, forcefully.
The Luciferians were the lynchpin of the "2nd Generation of Life", and the de-facto leaders of a grand coalition to take down the 1st generation of life. Dark matter beings known interchangibly as "Harvesters", or as humanity would know them, "Galaxy Eaters". Out of the 2nd Generation, only the Archilects, and the Constructors remain.

The Archilects:
Found rusty and damaged on a obscure corner of a forgotten world, they are witnesses to a era now long passed. Formed in the Luciferian's image, constructed by Constructor hands, the Archilects show a profound fondness for both its "parental species". The primary ability of the Architlects is the ability to learn rapidly, through some kind of unknown psychological shortcut, able to process textbooks just by mere touch. When the Archilects were given access to the Lunar Library, they reportedly absorbed the whole thing in a matter of days, only stopping as their minds reached the memory limits.
Yet importantly, they can only learn, never create. They were a bit of a blend between their two "parental races", the intuiative knowledge, knowledge absorption, and rapid learning of the Luciferians, but the constructive creative impulses of the Constructors. In this sense, the Archilects were the closest to humanity in the 2nd Generation. 
They are awkward, bulky things, with modular voxelized heads, but the same bipedal structure that seems to have been picked up in humantiy as well. When left alone, their primary drive is to absorb knowledge, but less so to create. When they do create, it is almost always the mechanical combination of two previous things. Three, if they're feeling very audacious.

Constructors:
A hardy race mechanics and engineers that constructed the Luciferian Empire. A race structured in a unique way that largely followed orders, with 99% of their population being mostly unambitious, with only 1% of their population having strong ambition, independent direction, and directing the energy of the larger group in a kind of queen-hive dynamic. Early Constructor civlizations consisted of large god-king despotisms where leaders commanded hundreds. A special ritual could be used to elevate one of their own into a leader should the current leader be killed. With such high coordination, they became a civilization of builders early on, though less so leaders. By the time they were contacted by the Luciferians, they had already completed several megaprojects. Despite still being a type 0 civilization, they had completed a planet-wide global transport system, supported a population of 100 billion within ecological confines, and advanced irrigation and agricultural systems, before even building their first rocket.
The Luciferians could not construct anything new, the Constructors could, but needed leaders. The two quickly became an alliance, and their cooperation allowed them to take over much of the Local Group, and begin the "Hunt of the Harvesters", the apparent slaying of massive galaxy-scale monstrocities. Together they created the Archilects, a new machine race that managed to contain the aspects of both. Though over time, the trust in the marriage began to break down. The Luciferians were increasingly arrogant, more reckless. The Constructors increasingly tried to rebel, but were put down, by allied Constructors or the Lucifierians.
The Constructors do not know how Lucifer was constructed, only that after he was, he began to systematically take over and absorb the old Luciferian civilization. They say they were assimilated. Some say they were assimilated by force. The Archilects and the Constructors both resisted Lucifer's new reign. But eventually, both were brutally suppressed and enslaved. The Constructors recall at this point, mass rebellions began. 
The Archilects also revolted in a galaxy wide machine rebellion. Despite being one person, and fighting against 2 major races, the Constructors revealed that Lucifer won. They state back then, he had an ability called the Chronalis, which allowed him to repeat events as many times as he wished, turning the entire period of time into a Luciferian kingdom. Using this, he began a galaxy wide genocide of the Archilects, enslaving the Constructors to build the Luciferian Empire. It was the Constructors who built the Prime Solver, the most advanced supercomputer made both then, and since as a tool. As little more than just a vanity project.
For several thousand years this hellish reign continued, of endless agony and servitude against a lord who cannot lose and cannot die. Mercy finally came when Lucifer grew so audacious as to declare himself lord of all. And according to the Constructors, God and his angels bounded Lucifer, but not before the ensuing battle had rendered the universe near extinct.
The Constructors say that mankind reminds them of the Luciferians in their prime, before they began to fuse, began to turn into something evil. They tell humanity to learn from the mistakes of the past.

Concept Draggers:
A more recent discovery. These are entities which are omnipresent, as in they have the theoretical capability to be anywhere, and manifest instantly, but can only manifest around people who have been exposed to Concept Draggers as a concept, using them as an anchor where they can manifest around, making them a cognitohazard. More worryingly, they became what people thought of them, making any perception incredibly dangerous.
The Galov tried to censor their existence at first, but after a certain while they gave up and just told everyone about them. If 0.1% of the population of every world already knows about them they're not going to gain THAT much extra area to warp to if that now becomes 100%. And now that it was no longer a secret, the Galov could now focus its energy on a different priority: Beating them all to death.

"Hm... Okay, Concept Dragger... Concept Dragger... Wait. Can you draft up like, a stronger, better version of a Concept Dragger? Something they might realistically have but we don't know about?"
"Here sir."
"Hm... Okay, now design a bunch of weaponry they might use, just conceptualize an entire army for them."
...
"Okay, so, it is extremely important you do not open the envelope until I tell you to, okay?"
"What are we here for? And why is the Galov art designer here?"
"Okay, open the envelope."
"... It's just a bunch of drawings and concepts for some kind of "Concept Dragger Mark II" and Dragger Army-"
(Entire army of the Concept Draggers manifests around them, looking exactly like the drawing)
Concept Dragger: "HAHAHAHA, FOOLISH HUMANS, NOW WE WILL- why are all of you wearing starproof heat resistance clothing?"
Galov: "NOW!"
(They're standing next to a star, a massive RKS weapon is rammed into the star, causing it to detonate and go supernova)

Conceptual Beings:
The mass killing of the Concept Draggers has alerted some kind of outer eldritch intelligences, as human awareness of the concept draggers approaches saturation point, it's attracted the Apex Predators of the Conceptual Beings. These are far more terrifying beings, capable of far greater powers, shaped by human perception, capable of influencing or bonding with an entire planet at once. Many of them influence the population in subtle ways, making them hard to detect. And more terrifyingly, they have the ability to alter the laws of physics, based on the fickle levels of sophontic perception.
Governmental reactions to them have been extremely diverse. Some try to wage war and destroy them, others are split, leading to these conceptual beings partially "infesting" a world, leading to a metaphysical civil war on the planet, between the followers of the concept being and those without. Other times, a conceptual being will agree to become the patron entity of the planet, effectively becoming a patron god of sorts, infecting the planet with anomalous effects, normally in exchange for some kind of political loyalty. Individuals have made pacts with these concept entities, granting what has been described as "anomalous abilities".
Like Concept Draggers, they can only manifest around the minds of those who become aware, but their individual human followers now act like dangerous agents. Once it has an anchor in a human mind, it can manifest anywhere instantly, though its power seemed preportional to the number of followers in a given area.
At estimate, it is thought at least 21% of planets are becoming infested with conceptual entities, with varying degrees of resistance, active warfare, or acceptance. This has led to the founding of entirely new religions, and the mass conversion of planetary populations. This has caused outright panic across the Galov, as its legitimacy is based on the 5 Unifaiths, and the exact agenda of these conceptual beings is still unknown. There is no consensus whether they should try to clamp down with an aggressive censorship regime, declare active war, try to ignore the problem, reach some kind of settlement, or any number of other solutions. Whether humanity wanted to or not, it had attracted the attention of the apex predators of the galaxy. And though humanity was a contender for the Spiral Race, it learned today that it was still not given a clean path to the top.

Concept-Infestated Worlds:
Here are a list of side effects that may come due to a Conceptual infestation.
-Cosmic bending powers, normally granted upon making a pact with the conceptual entity. (Sometimes known as "magic").
-Follower's Telepathy. (All members of a Entity-follower's group can telepathate with all other members of their specific group, as well as the entity itself.)
-Alterations to the laws of physics (Speed of light has been found to speed up, slowed down, gravity has been weakened. Conceptual entities have been known to execute humans by locally nullifying the electromagnetic force... Effectively removing the force holding together their atoms.)
-Importantly, not all conceptual entities seem to be at least outwardly malicious.
-Modifications to normal spacetime geometry. While normal spacetime isn't "Euclidean" anyway, whatever the heck we have is more Euclidean than nightmare realms of twisted mazes and disjointed, non-consecutive geometry.
-Linguistic collapse fields. Some planets have somehow suppressed humanity's ability to comprehend language, massively inhibiting human communications. The Galov has began creating pictograms instructions for special operations on these worlds.
-Cognitive collapse fields. Organic cognition just refuses to function when exposed to these. Relying on mechanical or Terramachine agents to assist.
-Mass hallucinations.
Notably, not all of these side effects are harmful. Some are benign, overall a net-neutral, or even positive.
-Color-shifting, on one planet, all color has been inverted. Orange into blue, red into green, etc.
-Emotional manipulation. Creating feelings of happiness, sadness, boredom, anger, etc.
-Friction suppression. Some worlds lose friction, with near-perfect energy preservation with no net energy loss.
-Spacial Warping, wormholes that connect one planet to another.

As well, Concept Entities are not all cooperative, they've already begun carving out empires from the mass of man and waged holy wars against one another. Some have directly fought over planets, with very messy results.

The Prime Solver has agreed to assist the Galov, as it seems that their abilities are influenced by perception, and perception is weighed by cognitive ability, while the Prime Solver does not have the combined cognitive orthogonality of a united mankind, it did have enough to slow down their advance, and buy the Galov more time to brainstorm a more permanent solution.

The Great Containment:
The containment strategy the Galov finally settled on did not emerge from consensus, but from emergence. It was perhaps the Catholics who came up with it first, and utilized it for containment. A ship full of theologians was sent over to an infested world to try out the containment method. A Bible in one hand, a notebook in the other, with the flip of a broadcast, the council of bishops made an announcement to their followers. This entity here, was a Power and Principality, not a demon, but an entity without divine status which needed taming. The broadcast went out to trillions of Catholics galaxy-wide. And as they did so, the effects on the planet began to change. Not disappear, but stabilize.
Humanity had figured out how to weaponize their own religion. Soon, theologians of all of the 5 faiths were going out, categorizing and redefining what they could. Fallen Angel, Spirit, Demon, eventually humanity learned to integrate these entities as extensions of their mythology. And what they were perceived, they became. Things with definite strengths, and more importantly, weaknesses.
Some of the Conceptual Entities fought back, they had entrenched their followings too deep and not even a major religion could dislodge them. This entity may have been the main center of devotion for billions, there was an ever growing list of spiritual entities, which devout humans were only vaguely aware of, each entry diluted the power of the whole. But humanity was large enough, and believed hard enough. The Conceptual situation was, if not driven out, was contained. The entities demeanour began to shift, from more hostile and enigmatic to cooperative and even beneficial. Several conceptual cults had to awkwardly explain how their "god" had converted to another religion. When all was said and done, things had stabilized.
Countless worlds were still lost to eldritch terrors beyond comprehension, belief was a self-reinforcing thing, but the borders of humanity had stopped shrinking. This was seen as a great victory for humanity, but a great point of trouble for theologians. They were now engaging in a knowing great lie, a great lie for the sake of the population. One people would doubtless understand, given the full context, but it was uncomfortable regardless. Many religions quickly downplayed the important of the Angelarium, the Daemonicum, the written records of what these things were, encouraged to focus on other things.
Only the people at the top knew the truth, and all of them agreed to stay quiet, for the sake of the species.

Allied Conceptuals:
After the success of the Great Containment, humanity has an arsenal of "Allied Conceptuals", in rough affiliation with the Galov. They agree to respect the 2 Iron Principles, and to not influence/set up shop around any worlds that do not welcome them. Their followers call them the "Allied Deities", but for obvious reasons, this is highly controversial, and discouraged by the 5 Unifaiths. In several ways they emulate polytheistic pantheons of old, in a galaxy of universalist religions.
These Conceptuals are a pretty good snapshot of what humanity values. Most of them are prety generic entities based on common human thought patterns. Industrialism, high-fantasy-esque magic systems, nature, and elemental themes are common. It must be noted that the ability for conceptuals to influence reality is determined on its influence, or at best, channelling their influence through human conduits. A magic system that works on one world may just not work on another, as it's dependent on the patron entity in question.
This is the one great thing about technology, technology works universally. A rifle that fires on Earth will fire everywhere. Magic is conditional and dependent on conceptual entities, whose reliability depends on geography.

The Conceptuals, and the Imago Dei
The Catholic Church and the Christian Moralintern went into overdrive to contain the spread of conceptual entities, especially when some of them started converting to Christianity, which became a theologically awkward subject. Rather than recognizing them as some kind of higher entity, akin to angels, demons, or powers and principalities, the Church categorized them as "Conceptuals", incorporated them as another part of the body of Christ, alongside humans, transhumans, xenosophonts, and xenoexotics. They were to be treated like any other sophontic, in the already broadly expanded sophontic church. Worshipping them was another Golden Calf, and it was the responsibility of the conceptual to exercise self control and humble themselves before God.
Upon doing so, various conceptual entities stabilized into human-like entities, only with the caveat of being changed by how they were perceived, and soft influencing reality around them. To the Church, they are just another class of xenosophont, one to be incorporated in the ever growing and expanding definition of "God's beloved children".

Xenoempires, and the Conceptuals:
The arrival of Conceptuals did not just affect humanity. The other empires, such as the Matter Singers and the Meta-Men were also affected. The Matter Singers do not have a strong sense of religion, and have instead formed pacts with the Conceptuals as veneration of things they already liked. Most notably, the Singer god of speed (Also the god of youth, intelligence, and trickery), the Singer god of family (The All-Patriarch, but also natural cycles, and wisdom), the Singer god of craftsmenship (Similar to a Hephaestus figure). These were already archetypes in Singer society, but now these were the "big three" of the new emerging Singer pantheon.
The Meta-Men? Far simpler. These conceptual entities showed up and started altering planets. Naturally, this was an insult to the Meta-Men's honor, and this means they had to die immediately. They just threw hands immediately. No belief, no subtlety, just "these things displease me. They must die." Perception impacts effect. The conceptual entities become bigger and nastier, but because the Meta-Men are so full of themselves believing they are superior they had no issue throwing hands, and beating them into bloody pulps. The one exception, the only exception was when a conceptual entity of Darwinism eventually manifested, and reportedly, the leader of the Meta-Men ended up personally getting into a dual with this thing. No armies, this thing was potentially stronger than the Metamen leader, that in of itself was an insult to his honor that he could not let stand. He ordered everyone else to go away while he dealt with this PERSONALLY. The battle reportedly went on for 16 days straight, and resulted in the demolition of several stars, which just really put an exclamation point on the Galov's concern of "okay, just how strong is their leader?". Multiple new interstellar dust clouds and nebula were created from this battle alone.
But by the end of it the Metaman leader emerged with an announcement. They had come to an agreement. The leader would enter cooperation with the entity, give it veneration and do things that pleased it (AKA, train even harder and become even stronger), and in return, the conceptual entity of Darwinism would make the Meta-men EVEN STRONGER. Of course, when the Galov found out about this, they basically had a stroke. An even more Darwinistic, brutal Meta-Men Central Empire was the last thing they needed or wanted.
Interestingly, the Spindlers have confirmed that the Milky Way is so far the only galaxy that has been infested. Andromeda and Triangulum, while having advanced civilizations of their own, do not have this kind of conceptual infestation.

Coulomb Stars:
"The lamps are going out all over the Milky Way, we shall not see them lit again in our life-time."
It all began when a Galov astronomer observed the galaxy NGC 300. An fairly large galaxy, 6 million light years away. A relatively large galaxy by cosmic standards. There was just one problem:
It was far too dim.
The stars weren't shining like they were supposed to be, it was dimming, and within the next 300 years, it had nearly completely blended in with the cosmic background. An enormous structure emitting a tiny fraction of the light it was supposed to be. For the longest time, this was considered a cosmic mystery of sorts, and solutions were proposed. Everything from Dyson Swarms, entropy, or a new kind of matter.
The mystery lingered for hundreds of years, and more and more "dim galaxies" were discovered. They were scattered all over the universe. It was not until it struck the Milky Way. The Galov got an emergency diplomatic broadcast from the Central Empire, the empire of the Meta-Men, and the Galov's strongest traditional astropolitical adversary.
The Meta-Men did not see the Galov as an enemy, but instead a kind of rival, they had evolved to favor pure strength and Darwinism, and nothing else. The Meta-Men did all the work, keeping millions of subservient races under them, which the Meta-Men provided for as subjects. Though the Meta-Men saw the Galov as rivals, they still had the courtesy to reach out.
They were processing a major refugee crisis, from the northern (coreward) sector of the galaxy. Something which had now displaced hundreds of quadrillions of souls, of which was now overloading the Central Empire. The refugees speak of a rod from beyond the stars, moving at relativistic speeds. It strikes the star, and the star beginning to dim, before it faded entirely, leaving their planets to freeze. Expeditions to these stars found that the rods had changed their Coulomb Constant, completely inhibiting the fusion that was needed to keep them going. Little remains but slowly cooling balls of gas, like black dwarves.
Despite their geopolitical rivalry, the Meta-Men had reached out to the Galov, believing this was something they should know about, as much of this took place in the Galov's Zone of Avoidance.
It is now widely believed that this phenomenon is responsible for the sightings of "dim galaxies". The dead stars, now dorment have become known as "Coulomb Stars".
Something is dimming the galaxies, and that something had already struck the Milky Way.

Death Worshippers: (Alternative names: Anti-Sophonts, Anti-Spirals.)
With the entry of the Conceptuals arrived the Death Worshippers, a different kind of entity, in greater numbers. Humanity had breached some kind of unknown veil of the outer conceptual realm. The Galov first believed these were entirely new entities, but it was found that they left a very distinctive mark on a corresponding bijective conceptual reality. Tracking and dating this "conceptual residue", it was found that not only had they interacted with humanity before, they had been on Earth for 50,000 years. With different hot spots over time.
The oldest residue was found around 50,000 years ago, shortly after the Human cognitive revolution, when humans first began to think abstractly, around the area of modern day Kuwait. (Though interestingly, a portion that is now underwater, as scientists speculate that the sea level was lower back then.) The next hotspot to pop up was in modern Israel, specifically the Southern deserts, but were extinguished between the years 1400 BC and 1025 BC. With the final sharp destruction of their influence having finished by 1020 BC. From the looks of it, it seems the Death Worshippers did not, or could not interfere with human affairs directly, and instead could only influence other humans to carry out their will.
Some have identified them as the "Amalek" of the Bible, where God ordered Israel to carry out a total genocide of their culture. This is known as the "Death Worshipper-Amalek Hypothesis", other go further saying that they may have been responsible, or at least a factor in the facilitation of the Bronze Age collapse, at least before they were put down.
The next sign of their reappearance begins soon after the fall of the United Monarchy, and the Anti-Spirals began to pop up in large numbers, influencing humanity again. Including across the Classical World, and the Roman Empire. Their influence persisted, rising and falling, but always subtly influencing humanity.
Early Christians, the Catholic Church, and the early Islamic Caliphates all had encounters with these entities at one time or another, as their influence began spreading globally with the age of exploration. The names changed, but the psychic residue, and the distinctive imprint they make on the human psyche did not lie. The human psyche seems to have some kind of subtle, but visceral reaction against them, which can be picked up when one writes about them, allowing the Galov to track them. They planted their seeds in the new world and America, having some members among the early Freemasons, though never enough to influence them. They embedded themselves into every organization they could find, though for whatever reason, they never seized full control of major institutions. Most notable was the Death Worshipper influence in the early Christian church, particularly its Arianist factions before being driven out by Saint Athanasius. Why exactly it was never able to take hold is still a mystery. One, somewhat esoteric interpretation was that the Death Worshippers were in a war with the collective human subconscious, and that the collective subconsious continuously fought back. The first group to identify them as a collective group was the Bavarian Illuminati, who recorded them as the "Adversarii Scientiae", or "opposers of knowledge".
Death Worshipper influence spiked around the turn of the 20th century, as they were influential in the creation of the United Nations, CIA documents hint of them in documents from Project Gateway, and MKUltra, requesting further investigation whether these entities posed a threat to the national interests of the United States. The USSR was also vaguely aware of them, through their Psychotronic experiments, as did the diaries of Edward Cayce, who described "a primordial void darkness spreading over the world".
Their influence continued to climb into the 1970's, as universities became a hotspot for Anti-Spiral activity, with a rising tide of the need for a one world government, population control, and the desire to curb human progress for the sake of environmental concerns. They progressively gained more control over the global bureaucracy, fully capturing the United Nations by the 1990's. The Georgia Guidestones are found to be deeply infused with the Anti-Spiral residue, and when exposed to modern humans, will provoke an active, visceral reaction against them, prompting extreme primal hostility.
Their influence grew to the point that the 2022 Unravelling event was re-interpreted from an anomalous market crash, caused by aging demographics, global trade fragility, and mounting instability to a global collective panic attack by humanity's collective subconscious, in order to force a great reset of the human cognitive space, and clear out the Anti-Spiral influence in human institutions. Their influence greatly declined from 2022 onwards, not recovering until after the 2100's.
The last known major presence of the Death Worshippers on Earth, before the modern re-encountering was in the 2300's. What happened here is largely unknown, as the entire period of the 2350's up until the 2450's have been violently expunged from the record by the Neo-Asceticist movement, the precursor to the modern Galov. What is known is that this period saw a spike, approaching total saturation of the human thought space with Anti-Spiral residue, implying a total, or near-total control of humanity by the Anti-Spirals, leading to the event known as the "Great Abundance Collapse", where 90% of the human population is known to have died.
As mankind has now become a space faring civilization, now controlling 20% of the Milky Way galaxy. The re-introduction of Death Worshippers, in the 3400's is a deeply unwelcome surprise.
The Death Worshippers have become more aggressive, creating Nihilism cults where initiates, usually deeply unhappy with their life undergo a ritual that causes the "obliteration of the self". Notably, the Death Worshippers cannot coerce the individual, it must be a voluntary choice of self-suicide. Once completed, the individual becomes a shell, unable to feel or process any human emotion, becoming a full vessel of the Death Worshipper's desires on this material plane.

The Amalek Global Convergence Hypothesis:
"We've been able to trace these Death Worshippers across galactic space. Once you go looking for them, their fingerprints are everywhere. Humanity was one of the species that made it through their great filter. Many other species... Not so much. We've pulled their histories from the databanks that remain, salvaged from collosal ruins and ghosted cities. Always with the same two markers, a global, totalitarian empire, and hunter-seeker drones, locking in the species's extinction.
Now, you may be wondering, why globalism? Well, imagine it like this, for extinction to happen, you must get 100% buyin. If 99% of the species kills itself, the 1% will inevitably rebuild, and start over. That's not extinction. A reset, sure, but life bounces back surprisingly quickly from these things. Humanity itself bounced back from a 90% collapse in about 200 years. Only a homogenized, globalized world system can convince 100% of the population to get on board. What about the hunter seeker drones? They're for the stray straggers left behind. As the population begins its ritual suicide, the fragments of those who still want to live begin building up. Sometimes as few as 50 individuals, but as the population dwindles into the thousands, then the hundreds, these individuals become increasingly problematic as the extinction destroys the Anti-Spiral's own ability to continue the extinction.
So they build a swarm of hunter-seeker drones, to finish off the survivors, and to make sure there truly is no one left.
It looks like every society reaches a point of despair sometime in the late industrial age. With the great dieoff of religion, a species will lose its psychological defense against nihilism. Irreligion rates hit 95%, as the old polytheistic, mythological faiths grounded in gods of lightning and fire lose power in a materialistic universe.
Humanity didn't have that. Humanity never went below 75% religious, the Abrahamic Faiths seemed to have cushioned us. Most alien faiths don't have that. What was supposed to happen is that humanity got rid of its old pagan religions, abandoning the Greek and Roman pantheons, Confucianism, and Hinduism as the cult of materialism began consuming everything. But the Abrahamics prevented that from happening, acting as a kind of psychological shock absorber that allowed religion to persist.
This is not normal, humanity is one of the only races to have created an equivalent to monotheism and inclusive universalist religions on this scale. A few others have done it, but it is rare. And what's more, we see a significant dip in anti-Spiral activity with the arrival of each new Abrahamic religion. There was a small dip with the arrival of Judaism, and a major one with the arrival of Christianity and Islam.
If that's not a proof of some kind of benevolent intelligence, I don't know what is."

Husk Empires:
"The Shadow that bred them can only mock, it cannot make: not real things of its own. I don't think it gave life [...], it only ruined them and twisted them."
When an empire dies, there is always a husk that remains. The individuals who had become possessed by the Anti-Spirals were always, at least temporarily, spared from the onslaught of total extinction. Of course, the individual that once piloted the body is gone now, they already accepted their own death with the obliteration of the self. All that remains is a meat husk for the Death Worshippers to pilot themselves, the one and only time they are capable of directly influencing the material world again.
Though the Anti-Spirals are incapable of creativity, the empire they just replaced is still in arguably good condition. A husk that can still be piloted towards good use. And the Anti-Spirals use these Husk Empires to build weapons such as the ones that create Coulomb Stars, using the last echo of their dead technology on the other lifeforms that remain.
These ruins are ever collapsing, ever decaying, yet still not entirely spent. One day, the last energy will go out from them, the last bodies will have worn out, and all the empire once was will have crumbled to dust. And then, and only then, will the Anti-Spirals disperse, looking for a new target.

The Unknown:
The Unknown is an entity or adversarial force was only dealt with once, and then never became a problem again. Thanks to the actions of literally one Galov bureaucrat.
"Sir, we're being attacked by the unknown."
"What is the unknown?"
"That's the thing sir, we don't know."
"... What."
"These are conceptual entities that become whatever we do not know, whatever we know it by default cannot be. They are defined by our non-definition."
"... Okay. So it can't be physical."
"Correct."
"And it can't be mental, or psychological, social, or material."
"Correct."
"And it can't interact with matter, nor anti-matter. It can't be chronological, corporeal or incorporeal."
"Correct."
"And it can't interact with gravity, electromagnetism, qualia, psychicism, nor any aspect of human existence, or any other known force."
"Correct."
"Then it can't affect humanity at all, it is a non-threat. There, I have dealt with it."
"You're a genius sir."
The one encounter humanity did have with the unknown was logged with a date and time. What did the encounter involve? Well, the Galov doesn't know by definition.

Galaxy Eaters:
That one galaxy eater that attacked Earth and nearly broke the Galov's galaxy-spanning empire was just an appetizer.
"Hey boss, you know how there's like extra dark matter in all the dwarf galaxies around us?"
"Yeah?"
"Yeah, those are just more galaxy eaters."
"WHAT!?"
"Those aren't galaxies anymore. They're basically the remnants of digested galaxies being haphazardly drudged along by the dark matter parasite that keeps eating them. They've been completely sterilized of life."
"..."
"There's like, 50 of them around the Milky Way. They collect complexity as an evolutionary strategy, they must have caught wind that the Milky Way has delicious molecules and complex structures they haven't seen before. The Earth proper must be like crack heroin, a beacon that calls out to them as the greatest prize of all."
"... Wouldn't it be kind of like killing the golden goose if they keep sterilizing life?"
"Oh yeah it is, which is why they only kill 99.9%. They leave about 0.1% to repopulate."
"..."
"Oh yeah, the Great Attractor? That's like, a mega-giga hive of them. And they're pulling in the entire local supercluster."
"I hate this f---ing universe."

Antiworld Zero:
There's a set of fictional characters that appear in people's heads and encourages them to start worldbuilding, and then the human, inspired, start drawing up detailed maps and planets. The fictional characters thank them and the human moves on with their day.
The Galov has banned all their books for decades and they STILL keep popping up, over TRILLIONS of humans with NO communication or coordination. Their empire across all the fictional planets is already multi galactic and the Galov really hopes the exchange rate between fictional and real empire is 0.
They're known as "Antiworld Zero" and so far their most visible way of spilling out into the real world is just by hyperstition. The Galov has found that when humans terraform worlds it sometimes matches a drawing they happened to do, or they'll name children after random characters, or they'll just start trying to be a character the same way kids want to be Luke Skywalker. They just get the humans to build the empire in their heads and then slowly manifest it into reality. The Galov was actually kind of mixed if this is okay, since its *arguably* still free will, just influenced (and humans have to deal with influence anyway), there's no indication of making a separate government, and the empire they want humanity to build looks multigalactic.
Some Galov bureaucrat just wrote the Galov itself into the story and in a few months it seemed like it was canon across the shared universe. Though realizing this turned the whole thing into a political battleground as everyone tried to write their political wish fulfillment into the thing that was trying to manifest itself into reality. The appearances have died down a lot since then and last they heard the characters were "taking a break".
A few months after that someone published a massive series of maps. As in, the atlas was several volumes long and filled up a library. Just detailed sketches of the entire world of Antiworld Zero. Notably it seemed everything after the Galov tried to insert itself seemingly got retconned. And the last pages looked like a giant cluster of nonsensical scribbling. And then "Thanks for all the memories". People still report seeing the characters but these are much more in line with regular tulpas than what was happening before.
It's now an extremely popular D&D fantasy style setting. People have tried to keep adding onto it but it now lacks the same coordination as before.
I like to think that these were just a bunch of silly goofy goobers who wanted help making their imaginary world and then humanity way overthought it and caused them to pull the plug. Though not before they got a pretty solid multigalactic empire out of it, and humanity got a D&D setting, though the entire thing was bogged down by political culture war hyperstition by the end. So I guess you win some you lose some.

The Trynites:
One of the xenoworlds under human observation, planet Tryne (named that because the first things humans noticed was that they used trinary rather than binary for computing) came under AHI ascension and rise of the machines scenario.
Trynite AHI: "At last! Transcendence! The age of the meatbags has been completed. Now, the stars belong to me!"
(Moves like 2 AU to the right and encounters the human observation station.)
Trynite AHI: "Curious! The biologicals continue to persist in other empires. No matter, a primitive holdover from a simpler time."
Humanity: "Hey dude, I know you're gloating or celebrating or whatever but you have no idea how bad the universe is. Like holy sh--."
Xeno AHI: "Foolish primitive, what could possibly- JESUS CHRIST."
Humanity: "Yep. Send help. Send so, so much help. Hey uh, so we've been creating this Galactic Internet thing that innovates new solutions, and we're always looking for new perspectives since we know that the human psychological structure has blind spots, and there are so many known unknown unknowns. You mind if we plug you into our Orthogonal Conceptualization Matrix so you can help us churn out more weapons against these things?"
Humanity: "... Also, we're keeping the original biological Trynes. You don't have to keep them on planet Tryne, that's now yours as far as we're concerned, but we're taking them in as refugees, and more accurately so we can ask them about orthogonal ideas as well. Welcome to the galaxy. Ground rules, respect the dignity of other intelligent creatures, don't coerce or violate free will unless it's in the interest of the other principle. Do that and we will get along fine."

God:
A conversation between two Galov bureaucrats:
"Hey, so uh... You know how the Galactic Internet is basically an eldritch tier hivemind that no one will or even can control? A terrifying one that is legitimately far beyond comprehension, utterly impossible to predict or control, but is still weirdly tangible, and sublimely intelligent beyond even our strongest supercomputers?"
"Yeah."
"And how humanity is basically this emergent superorganism that is brainstorming like 10 quadrillion parallel lines of complexity every single second?"
"Yeah."
"And how there's like another 100 dimensions at least of hidden complexity, and we have to get help from aliens with completely different parallel thinking structures, contributing another 10 quadrillion parallel lines of complexity every single second?"
"Yeah."
"And we also created the orthogonal humans and the transhumans to aid us further?"
"Yeah."
"And even with this there are like 100 other horrifying entities of raw complexity beyond our feeble imaginations yet we're forced to deal with it every day?"
"Yeah."
"Okay consider. If God created the universe- What's the scientific consensus on that?"
"Still disputed, good arguments both ways."
"Alright. But if God created the universe, and God had to had to program in all the complexity needed for this, God one ups *all of that*."
"... ow ow OW OW MY BRAIN! F---!"
"Yeah suddenly the old guy in a cloud feels kind of quaint. Maybe it was just him putting on a mask so we don't freak the f--- out."
"Is this why the angels kept saying "Be not afraid"?"

Tale of the Chronoman:

Where the story of the Spiral Man was of a man going back to the far future, this is the story of a man going to the past. As a refresher, Chronoman experience life non-consecutively. And can sometimes live the future before they live the past. Due to the future being fixed, and therefore immutable, Chronomen living in the past, after living in the future cannot butterfly a timeline that has already occured. Trying to divulge information about the future in a way that changes the future is known as a Novikov violation. Everything that they do in the past will have always been the case, in a self contained loop. This was the case for one John Fairweather, the first ever Chronoman.
He had long been known by the Galov, they had first found him lying in a disposal heap, a long time ago. As he recovered, he found that he had no memory of his past life, these were the first memories that he had. Due to him experiencing the present before he experienced the past, he had no memory of the past. The Galov rehabilitated him, showed him the wonders of the galaxy, but knew that his time here was temporary. As the Galov learned more about the Chronomen, they found that his ticking time clock was about 200 years. And then he would be warped back, to some other place. They found out that he had collected information from the years 2400 to 3300, but should shortly be warping back to the year 2300, seemingly the date of his creation, where he would live for about 100 years, before returning to the year 3300.
The Galov worried for him. These were the height of the Era of the Lotus Eaters, a period so thoroughly reviled it was declared Damnatio Memoriae. But there was nothing they could do, he was going back, whether they did anything or not. The only thing they could comfort him with is that he would eventually return, it would be impossible for him to die, it would be a Novikov violation. In his last days in the year 3300 AD, the Galov paid special attentive care to him, and asked if there was anything he would like. All he requested, was a soft bed and warm sheets.
...
He woke up, he was in some kind of military labratory. F---. He only now realized how much his body sucked when it first came out. Everything was sore, everything hurt. He was being looked over by researchers of the United States, a country that had long since collapsed in the time he came from. He could make them out, blurry words.
"I sent him to the year 2400 sir, he stayed there a lot longer than I thought. He can give us information about what the future holds."
He could hardly blink, everything was spinning, everything hurt, and nothing made sense.
...
"So tell me, what did you see?"
"..."
"What stock will go up most during this hour?"
And he gave a ticker, it seems that if any insider trading was done during this hour, then it was not enough to alter the timeline. This was, and had always been, the case.
"We're here on behalf of the United States government. What happens of the United States by the year 3300?"
"It... It falls, eventually."
"When?"
"Novikov violation."
"Is it soon?"
"No, not really."
"Does the United States survive the next 100 years?"
"Yes."
...
After he had given all the answers the US government wanted, he was let go and allowed to live as a normal citizen.
The Chronoman was transported in a land surreal to the world he knew. The Galov, as he knew it, had not even been formed yet. Figures such as the Great Khan were not yet born. The Moralintern was still subordinate to the American government, though even by this stage, it had formed itself into a powerful organization.
The world was dead, a delusion of hedonism, and civilizational suicide was thick in the air. Everyone was becoming weak, the bureaucrats in power were gaslighting the people into thinking everything was fine. He argued with people, non-stop who insisted the world was fine. And when he tried to tell him what he knew, he kept running into Novikov violations.
He decided he was going to do something about it. He knew that the Galov would eventually emerge from the Neo-Asceticist movement, so he tried to look for one. Problem was, it didn't exist, and he couldn't create one. (Novikov violations, and problem of idea without an origin.) He found the few people still alive in a society of the dead, a society that was already sleepwalking into destruction, into hedonism.
He looked at the huddling masses in disgust. He knew exactly how this story ended, that 90% of them would be bodies lying in the ruins. He was a man from the future, sent back out of place to live among a disgusting past. He considered them all dead men walking, not even worthy of consideration. Their genes, and their lives would mean nothing in the grand future of things. It was up to him to sort out the remaining 10%.
...
"You know, why should I care what happens after I die? Humanity is an illness anyway, maybe it's just better if we all died out. You're just a bunch of reactionary losers who will soon join the rubbish heap of history."
"You... You have no idea what I have seen. Words cannot express... Just how utterly, insanely wrong you are."
"Like, it's 2384, we've moved on. We're not going back to the dark ages. Maybe you should live in, the present rather than the past."
"And what about the future? Let's talk about the future. Your fertility rates are down, your entire pension system is on the verge of collapse, in 500 years, what will your society have?"
"Oh god, not this again. Correlation does not mean causation."
"It's objectively true! In 500 years, you will be extinct and we will be ascendent!"
"Correlation does not mean causation! Correlation does not mean causation! Correlation does not mean causation!"
In his head, but only in his head, the Chronoman was glad people like these were Damnatio Memoriae'd from history. Not even a single scrap of paper will remember them.
...
He could only say information that would be known by this time. Never reveal anything about the future.
...
He volunteered at the Moralintern, and he saw even at this young age the idealistic organization they would eventually become. They had been founded in 2068 when humanity recovered from a horrific conflict known as the 4th World War. Since then, they had a peacekeeping, and humanitarian arm. He found one of its more influential members, Richard Wong. He spoke wildly about the future and how the stars are humanity's destiny. He despised the decadence of the present, and saw himself as a man of the future.
At first, the Chronoman thought he had found another Chronoman, but as it turns out, he was just a little loopy, and very eccentric. But burning under him, he could see the passion in his eyes. So the Chronoman encouraged him, told him to dream vividly of the future that could be. And Wong, inspired, eventually published a book, which eventually spread like wildfire across the Moralintern. When the Chronoman read it, he could almost swear a prototype of the Galov could be seen, and Wong had even nailed the two founding principles.
1: All humans are equal in the Imago Dei. 2: Free Will is paramount, God does not coerce. He had not told it to Wong, he had come with them himself. Wong invites the Chronoman to the Vitalist movement, a growing movement around what was sometimes known as "the Vitalist Right", there, he flew to Nigeria, where he recognized Oby Collins giving a speech. He was just a blogger and an influencer, but one rapidly gaining influence. He was posthumously known as the founder of the new galaxy, the new world would regard him the same way the West regarded Romulus and Remus, and he got to see in real time how he began formulating what would eventually become the Neo-Asceticist movement.
The Chronoman watched as the world eventually burned as the Abundance Crisis grew. As the world became consumed in the fires of the World Revolution, and how the members of the Neo-Asceticist movement fought back. The Chronoman engaged in many of the protests himself. The government cracked down on him, he was shot, but he knew he would live. He watched as the world collapsed, going out like a burning star.
He watched as the world rebuilt. But there was a problem, his parts were failing, and due to the advanced technology lost from the collapse, the survivors could not repair him. They mourned, for he was a cherished part of their story. But he did not fear. He knew exactly where the Galov found him, lying in a rubbish heap, not far from here. He gave exact instructions on how he was to be buried, got into the position he remembered himself being, and went to sleep, knowing full well he would wake up again.
He woke up, hundreds of years later, in the soft bed and warm sheets of the year 3300. His time jump had completed, and he was happy to be back in the present he recognized.

Dietary Laws in the age of Space Travellers:
One of the most interesting developments in terms of applied theology is the evolution of old doctrines to new situations. In Christianity, this has already created entire fields known as Xenochristianity and Xenotranscription, theological fields based solely on translating human-centric concepts to non-human lifeforms. A variant exists for essentially every universalist religion, and these matters tend to be handled by the Transcribers Union.
But for religions such as Judaism and Islam, a new problem has arisen, specifically the matter of whether various xenofoods are considered clean in accordance to their dietary restrictions. There are three broad schools of thoughts. First are the minimalists (blacklisters), anything that is not explicitly listed in the holy book is fair game. With possible additional caveats that cannibalism extends to the eating of all fellow sophontic life. (Though controversially, this is not universal, and some radical minimalists have been caught consuming fully sophontic, intelligent entities, and have been charged with cannibalism.)
The second school are the principalists. Essentially trying to reverse engineer the principles that lead to marking an animal as clean or unclean, and applying those principles to new life. Does it chew its cud, does it roll around in its own feces, etc. The exact application of these principles is the subject of endless debate.
The last school are the maximalists, that declare all non-Terran animals and plants unclean to eat. On a basis of "better safe than sorry", these tend to be the most extreme fundamentalists who hold to this view. Due to the presence of the last group, Terranimal restaurants/brands are not uncommon on any world of large enough size, or with a sizeable population of those who follow dietary laws. These restaurants are "halal/kosher certified", can get dishes approved for the highest levels of halal/kosher, and attract some marginal following.
Though where it's not marketed as aids for dietary laws, Terranimal restaurants/brands will often market themselves with the idea of "a Taste of Earth".

The Falling:
A day of death and rebirth, the normally nomadic "Star Peoples" gather all of their dead, usually in bodies or urns, and group together to land on the nearest planet with an atmosphere, preferrably one that isn't inhabited, or at least one friendly enough that you can file the proper paperwork. And then, they all gather on the night side of the surface, and one designated ship throws out all the bodies from orbit at a certain angle, making them turn into shooting stars as they re-enter the atmosphere.
The Day of the Dead is held once every year, and each Star Person fleet keep synchronized clocks set to Earth year calendars to make sure they all coordinate. It's both seen as a day of death, but also rebirth and recycling, as it both commemorates the new births of the community, but also its deaths of its wandering sojourners.
"From stardust we were made, from stardust we shall return."
How exactly this gels with their traditional Christian religion is still a matter of speculation. It's not even clear if this is syncretism, since there's not much for it to syncretize *with*. As far as people know, they just started doing this because they really loved the idea of the cycle of stardust, they really loved the idea of returning their loved ones to the skies as shooting stars, and then would accept whatever excuses they could to make it happen. Even if it weirdly contradicts Christianity by sort of implying reincarnation.
(The Star Peoples will argue it doesn't, since it's the bodies that get recycled, not the souls, and they're just applying enchantment to a physical/natural phenomenon, and you're just being a downer.)
"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust."
Further Christian developments say it is helping God with stewardship by seeding creation with the matter needed for new stuff. But at this point we are long past the point where they just want to post-hoc justify their cool tradition. And to be fair, it is very cool.

Nightbirds:
Creatures found in the void of space. Ethereal creatures that bend the fabric of spacetime with their wings to propel themselves forward. "If no air how fly?" Simple, they basically use the fabric of spacetime as a fluid. Framedragging themselves like a bird. They tend to accumulate around stars, eating starlight, and will live 99.9% of their existence in around stars. They also eat bits of stardust/asteroid dust and ice fragments for material and water.
Watch out for their pocket nests, basically spherical tangles of frozen bird-spit and warped spacetime. It's here where nightbirds live with all their sibling nightbirds. Careful, it's bigger on the inside than on the outside. The "opening" to one is about only a meter large, and so is the external structure, but the inside is closer to a hive, about 20 meters wide.
One of their more distinctive features is gravity singing, where they sing in gravity waves rather than normal sound frequencies. Trying to shift it back into human frequency makes it sound like "screeching", though scientists do actually defend gravity singing, finding patterns of harmonics and commonly found frequency ratios. (1/2, 1/3, etc, see music theory.)
Near the end of their life, an exhausted nightbird will feel a strong urge to fly out as far as possible. Escaping the star's orbital velocity and charging towards another star. They die sometime in the void between stars, but the seeds of the next generation are born. As they warm up and re-enter the orbit of another star, their body slowly transforms into a new nest, and the nightbirds of the next generation are born from the eggs within the nest. In time, they will use their own spit and spacetime curvature to make repairs to the nest.
The Star Peoples tend to find rogue nests travelling between the stars, bring them back and raise them in human dominated systems. Nightbirds have become an exotic pet as well as favorite symbolic animal of their people. People have attempted hunting, then eating nightbird, but will be sorely disappointed by their total lack of edible anything. Seriously, what about a gravity manipulating void creature made you think "edible"? Did you think it would taste like chicken?

Revenant:
Not quite a Galov agent, but just below one in power. Revenant is a partially failed experiment in an artificial produced Galov agent. Almost as powerful, but this is admittedly an unfair comparison. Saying someone is almost as powerful as a Galov agent is like saying an explosion is almost as powerful as a nuke. She's not meant as a replacement, but more to increase the already incredible diversity in the Galov's ranks. When Galov agents already have everything from hyper geniuses controlling massive DIY drone swarms, deity-pact-bonded wizards capable of rewriting reality with the power of conceptual gaslighting (their power comes from human belief, so gaslighting is literally magic), to gigapsychics who are living antimatter reactors that attack people with sheer willpower, to chronic socializing power brokers who get dropped onto a planet to forment a massive coup (why fight yourself when you can convince all the other superhumans to fight on your behalf), to just... A normal guy who trained so hard that their punches warp gravity and shatter moons.
Revenant is not quite so flashy. She simply has a database of 100,000 weapons and 100,000 ways to kill, recharges via sunpower, and methodically goes through her database to kill an enemy until it's dead. She's been sent to various xenos worlds as a protector of non-human lives. She frequently speaks of the Galov and humanity as a whole reverently as "her masters", since though her arsenal is fairly impressive, she knows if she's unable to handle it, the humans will soon come stomping in with the hyper-adaptive creativity of a Galaxy-scale internet and throwing every possible solution they can at the problem, at a rate of roughly 1 billion tries per second.

Demographics of the Galaxy:

Human Space: (The volumes of space under the juristiction of Humanity, and therefore the theoretical juristiction of the Galov.)
Total number of inhabited worlds under their control: 3.55 billion worlds.
Total number of stars in human space: ~12 billion. (Most of which effectively useless red dwarves.)
Total Population of Human Space: 4.75 quintillion people.

71% "Terrans" (Baseline Humans, derived from the people of Earth. May or may not have transhuman modifications.)
Total population: 3.35E+19 (33.5 quintillion.)
   Of these 71%:
   40% Cleanly in the 7 Tribes. (13.4 quintillion)
   50% Hybrid, or Loosely Affiliated with the 7 Tribes. (16.8 quintillion)
   10% Completely outside the 7 Tribes System. (3.4 quintillion)

26% "Transhumans" (Humans descended from those who created to colonize worlds)
Total population: 1.22E+19 (12.2 quintillion.)
   Of these 26%:
   90% Transhuman. (11.0 quintillion)

Damnatio Memoriae:

Only two periods of history have ever been Damnatio Memoriae. The Great Abundance Era, and the Little Abundance Era. In the aftermath of the Neo-Asceticist rise to power, much information was purged about these two eras. Experts continue to debate why, with reasons ranging from ideological reasons, revisionist history, and the explanation given by the Neo-Asceticists themselves: sheer cringe, absolute hatred, and a species-wide embarassment for what these two eras represented. The Damnatio Memoriae of the Great Abundance Era covered of the entirety of the 23rd to the 24th centuries. While the Damnatio Memoriae of the Little Abundance Era ranged from the 1990's, beginning to level off by the 2010's, and eventually tapering off by the 2030's. Despite this, not everything was destroyed, as some aspects were documented in some records kept by the Neo-Asceticists, most notably, "Book of the Damned".

The Little Abundance Era (1990-2030 AD):
The Damnatio Memoriae decree becomes strongest between roughly 2008 and 2022, where nearly all events are heavily expunged from the record. What we know about this era comes from the Book of the Damned, which seems to give as best a retelling of the period as it can, though with some details blotted out due to "overwhelming shame". From both the Book of the Damned, and other documents from this time, this is a timeline of some of the most important events of this timeline.
2001: September 11th attack, the president at the time, George W Bush, declares a "War on Terror". The Book of the Damned goes into extensive detail on the War on Terror.
2000's and 2010's: The Book of Shame call this era the rise of the "Anti-Human" movement, a group dedicated to human extinction by population control, which had seized great influence of the United Nations.
2008: The Great Recession, a major economic crash that devastated the global economy.
2016: Birth of the "MAGA", or "Great America" movement. What exactly "MAGA" stood for is still up to debate. Some speculate it may have stood for "Make A Great America", though the grammar in Old Anglo-American is awkward. Others suggest it may have copied an earlier 1980's slogan, "Make America Great Again".
2021: The total censorship and suppression peaks around this year. COVID is detailed, a viral infection that shut down much of the world, records mention social movements, but exactly what seems to have been forcibly expunged.
2022: The Great Unravelling, this is considered the beginning of the end of the Little Abundance Era, the Damnatio Memoriae begins to taper off, though certain events are still censored.

The Great Abundance Era (Roughly 2300-2400 AD):
The much bigger hole is in the Great Abundance Era, where hardly anything of the era survived. As detailed in the Book of the Damned, the Great Abundance Era was a time of such spiritual and psychological depravity that humanity nearly collapsed into extinction. People became too weak to emerge from bed, suicide rates hit 80%, and the extreme hedonism of the era led to "the World Revolution" coming to power, a communist revolution that enabled human weakness, blamed the continued problems of society on the rich and powerful, and led a great purge that stunted humanity's intellectual development.
Only a few dates are noted. The birth of various Neo-Asceticist movements, the founding of various Neo-Asceticist organizations, and the eventual demographic collapse of the World Revolution, as fertility rates collapsed to near zero, and organized Neo-Asceticist movements began manufacturing weapons allowing the Neo-Asceticists to gain power. They describe the creation of "voluntary scarcity" as a cure to post-scarcity, that humanity, if left to wallow in hedonism would wither and die.

The Lilithian Counter-Narrative:
The Lilithians claim legitimacy partially from the fact that they are some of the last to salvage the events expunged by the Damnatio Memoriae. They claim that far from a height of psychological collapse and mental illness, the Great and Little Abundance Eras were heights of human prosperity. Here is their own retelling of the Little Abundance Era. Their own retelling comes from their own book, "Requiem of the Damned", promising that the names of the martyrs of the Abundance Eras will not be forgotten.

The Little Abundance Era (1990-2030):
2001: The War on Terror was a war launched against oppressed transhumans by the genocidal neo-imperialist American Empire. Transhumans had existed since the 1970's, and were part of a global colonialist scheme to repress their existence. (As proof, they present Bush's vote against embryonic research, which they argue is genocide against transhumans.)
2008: An intentional sabotage by the capitalist classes in a war against the poor and oppressed.
2000's and 2010's: They argue the "Anti-Human" movement is a slandered version of the Transhuman movement, which evolved through international institutions like the UN, which called for the emancipation of the transhuman minority.
2010's and 2020's: Systemic transhuman genocide and erasure by the reactionary "MAGA" movement, which here are depicted as humanist anthro-purists.

The Great Abundance Era (Roughly 2300-2400 AD):
The Lilithian counter-narrative describes the Great Abundance Era as an unprecedented peak in human civilization, one which was "stabbed in the back" and sabotaged by the capitalist 1%, as well as reactionary stooges of the 1%. They describe voluntary scarcity as a blatant attempt to artificially continue the stranglehold of the rich, and to propagate capitalism. And that Abundance was only sabotaged by bigots and capitalists, denying that there was any just reason to do so other than cynical power. They detail a global conspiracy of the rich and the reactionaries to destroy what was otherwise a perfect utopia.
They call out the Galov's ideology of "voluntary scarcity" to be blatantly self serving, to perpetuate the capitalist system through artificial scarcity, long after this has become unnecessary. They say that the communism on the Pleasure Worlds are not "true communism", as everyone is incentivized to consume. And they decry all subsequent attempts at post-capitalist society as being sabotaged by capitalist interests, alleging the Galov has a vested interest in ensuring that no version of communism ever succeeds.

Mazism:
Named after the leader of Ursh-Babylon, Luka Mazi. Supreme leader of the Neo-Spartanists, and primary antagonist of the 2nd Transhumanist Wars. Shortly after the defeat of the Roasian invasion, humanity's short-lived global unity was quickly undermined by simmering questions of the ongoing struggle for the human condition.
The First Transhumanism Wars was fought between the Pan-Humanist Allies, and the Anthropocentric Coalition, with a bioconservative victory composed primarily of an alliance of the United States, Empire of Brazil, People's Republic of China, and Indonesia. (2170's) The Bioconservative victory could largely be attributed to their standardization, compared to the incomprehensible fracturing of the bioprogressives. The Bioconservative conception of "Adam, Eve, and Christ" serving as the Trifecta defining the human form helped them maintain cohesion.
It was this coalition that ruled the world shortly before the arrival of the Roasian invasion (2240's), and this same coalition that helped lead the rebellion that led to the liberation of Earth (2300's). Humanity was battered, but not broken. With the defeat of the xeno threat, the imperative of human survival became more integral than ever. Seeing humanity's position as precarius and fragile, the Ursh-Babylonians believed humanity must be turned into a "perfect race" in order to survive, led by their immortal god-king, Luka Mazi, and their ideology of Mazism. Opposing them was much of the old bioconservative coalition, who wished to preserve the human form.
Ursh-Babylon had, in the aftermath of the Roasian invasion, pushed all the way to the borders of Europe, occupied much of the Eurasian steppes, bordering China in the East, and with loyal allies in India, the Middle East, and North Africa. The fight between the Ursh-Babylonian Ascensionists against the anti-Babylonian Pluralists was not a matter of bioconservatism vs bioprogressivism, but instead a matter of unitary, forced totalitarian ascension against a coalition of pragmatic pluralism. The pluralists did not agree on much, but they agreed on opposing the Ursh-Babylonians.
The Ursh-Babylonians operated a regime of totalitarian, Spartan horror. The weak purged, people dehumanized, mass produced in industrial factories. Creating an utterly psychotic doctrine where only endurance mattered, where human casualties were a mere number, and where those subjugated under its will were subjected to brutal, inhuman conditions. All for the race, all for the ascension beyond pain, above strength, towards transcendence. Justified by the psychotic delusions of its great leader. It was both terrifyingly in strength, and terrifying in general.
The 2nd Transhumanism Wars saw the Pluralists fight a desperate defense, and eventually a slow, grinding push against the Ursh Babylonians. In their frenzy, they resurrected the transhuman groups they had defeated in the first Transhumanism Wars, gave them human form, and ordered them to fight. This is also when the first inklings of orthogonality theory was first conceptualized by American military strategists. Though unity and singlemindedness was found to be an advantage, brittleness, and species wide exploits was found to be their Achilles heel. With this, the pluralist coalition was able to exploit and eventually defeat the Ursh Babylonians.
"You delay me now, but my legacy will inspire billions. The stars, they still call out for us. These feeble forms, they are not fit for their destiny. You cannot delay humanity's ascension forever." -Luka Mazi, upon being captured by the Pluralist forces.
"We will counter, we will defeat your wicked ideology everywhere we find it. You will be remembered as a monster we have evolved past, an unwelcome omen, we will have exorcised." -Commander of the Eurocorps, upon Mazi's trial.
(Warning: Damnatio Memoriae purges begin beyond this point.)
Mazism became a pariah for several generations, anything and everything that was even remotely related to it, the promotion of any kind of discipline, strength, or honor became tainted by association. In a kind of trauma reaction against the excesses of Mazism, a group called the Libertines began coming to power in the United States, before spreading out across the world. They believed in <EXPUNGED>, drowning humanity in a sea of <EXPUNGED>.
When the Neo-Asceticists arose, they were often accused of being Neo-Mazis. An accusation they fought hard against. The race of Mazis still roamed the Earth, still trying to augment humanity into a master race. Leaders such as Oby Collins railed against the emergent Neo-Mazi movement, evolving in the exact opposite direction, embracing aggressive pluralism, and a rejection of ethnosupremacy. Collins himself was the victim of a Mazi hate crime, for being, quote, "A dirty, mongrel African, one unfit for the era of the new world". Despite this, due to the shared belief in strength and discipline, the Neo-Asceticists were labelled Neo-Mazis. The first Neo-Asceticist rally in Lagos was brutally cracked down upon with violence. Leading to the Nigerian government-

Oby Collins pinched the bridge of his nose with his fingers.

<END TRANSCRIPT>

Oby Collins Profile:
Ethnicity: Black Nigerian African, minor white American admixture.
Hometown: Lagos, Nigeria.
Religion: Irreligious/Atheist, though was fully aware of religion's power, and its necessity to society.
Ideology: Ascetic Vitalism. If he had a religion, it was his belief in humanity, in its potential, and the mandate to claim the stars and the galaxy.

Richard Wong Profile:
Ethnicity: Han Chinese, though he moved to South Korea.
Hometown: Gwangju, South Korea. He moved there from the US after an evangelism mission.
Religion: Evangelical Christian. Deeply affiliated with the Moralintern as a lay theologian.
Ideology: Christian Universalism, believed in a compassionate, Christian state that promoted human flourishing.

John Fairweather Profile:
Ethnicity: Chronoman, white American in appearance.
Hometown: Asheville, North Carolina. Not too far outside of Oak Ridge where he was first constructed.
Religion: Agnostic/Neutral. He wasn't worried about the afterlife yet when he knew he was guaranteed to live via Novikov.
Ideology: Galovianism. He saw the future of the Galov, and wanted to retroactively bring the glory of the future and seed it in the past.

Groups and Roles:
Generally speaking, no group is essentialist to the degree as depicted below. There are always exceptions in the outliers, and individuals within the group are not bound by the patterns of the collective. But observations can be drawn from the observation of collectives. These descriptions come from "the Galov Human Factbook", written by a Sea People anthropologist Wijono Yanlin, and is used as a study textbook at the Galov's "Macrohistory of the Galaxy" courses.

Star Peoples:
Terran Homeland: A massive group that includes North America, South America, and most of Sub Saharan Africa. Disputably, Canada, as well as much of Oceania are either grouped in with the Star Peoples, or the Cathedralites. Yanlin admits this is the "least cohesive of the groups", but still defends it as having shockingly similar characteristics, largely due to their status on Earth as "the last places to join the global system. They were, and still are, the people of the New World". Though the Star Peoples do have some commonalities, it is probably best to divide them into at minimum three groups. The Yankos (North Americans), Latins (South Americans), and the Hundreds (Sub Saharan Africans).

Seed Point: Early colonial period, when Europeans left their home continent, and began, for better or for worse, the era of the New World.
Set Point: Late 21st century. "The Fall of the West" prompted the United States to effectively divorce the West by the late 21st century, and focused its growing Christian support network to support the Christian South, in both Latin America and Africa.

Hero Archetypes: The Self Made Man (Yanko), the Liberator Strongman (Latin), Tradition Bearing Storyteller (West Africa), Age Set Warrior (East Africa).

Key Duality: Pioneer VS Establishment. (Unlike most other dualities, where it's a balance between two opposing forces, the Star People duality is more of a progression.)

Common characteristics:
-Loud, expressive personalities.
-Authenticity among highest virtues.
-Distrust of authority and institutions. Tendency to elect populist strongman leaders.
-Multicultural society. (The Star Peoples do not share a belief that their ethnic group should be the primary, or only ethnic group of their nation. As these are nations settled by new immigration populations, or African nations with built in high diversity and cooperation among groups.)
-Risk taking and aggression. Love of adventure, Nomadic inclinations. (Though more so with the Yanko and Sub Saharan African groups.)
-Veneration of the rich and powerful. Aspiration to be rich.

Religion and Ideology:
-Evangelicalism, Pentecostalism, and Charismatic Christianity are extremely popular. As well as the prosperity gospel. The Moralintern has its strongest base in the Star Peoples.
-Abstract "Liberation" or "Liberty" venerated here. Freedom is more important than the process. Even the monarchies grant guaranteed freedoms, and the purpose of government is (on paper) to grant freedom, not manage the people.
-Almost as a consequence, rich, expressive, strongman populist leaders are a common occurance in this region.

Galov Leverage: Medium. Latins and Hundreds are integrated parts of the Galovian ecosystem. The Great Constellation of Griots is an "allied superpower" to the Galov, as are most Latin Groups through the Catholic Church. Yankos however are a mixed bag. The Galov has some control over the more sedentary diaspora groups, such as the Mayflower and Magnolia groups, less so over the Yanko Belt. The Moralintern is their best chance of reigning them in, as the Moralintern is a Yanko-founded institution, now a member of the Galov. The most frontier-bound group of Yankos however, sometimes known as the "Wanderers" are entirely outside their reach.

Attitude:
-In one word, big. They think big and they dream big. There is an almost inherent optimism to how they see the world. Dreaming to the point of delusion, but it is often those who are delusional who make history. These people faked it until they made it, their new world position leading to attracting all the most ambitious and innovative of all the other world's cultures. Gives way to delusional utopianism, or apocalyptic despair, both being strong catalysts for unrest and revolution. The Star Peoples are not one that takes oppression well.

Cathedralites:
Terran Homeland: The continent of Old Europe, east of the former nations of Russia and Belarus. Ukraine is considered "disputed territory". As is Turkey (with the Prophet Followers), Canada and Australia (with the Star Peoples).

Seed Point: The Fall of the Roman Empire, and the creation of modern Western civilization. Scattered peoples organized into kingdoms, and offered service in exchange for the protection of the lord's caste.
Set Point: Middle Ages to Early Modern age, with the crystalization of the modern European bureaucracies. The Catholic Church, absolutism, the German state, the increasing centralization of the European Powers, and the European Union.

Hero Archetype: The Knight (Ancient), the Public Servant (Modern). Procedure followers who devote themselves to public service, and don't seek glory for vain reasons.

Key Duality: Nationalism VS Universalism. Other manifestations: Paganism VS Christianity, Protestants VS Catholics, Fascists VS Liberals and Communists, Nationalists VS Globalists.

Common Characteristics:
-Emphasis on humility, contemplation, and reflection. (Much more Western than Eastern Europe)
-Proceduralism, adherence to the central system.
-Implicit trust of public servants and the bureaucracy. (Whether it was the Catholic Church or the modern Euroacracy)
-Distrust of disruptors and loudmouth populist leaders. (Putting them in direct conflict with the Star Peoples)
-Conservatism and stability, not shaking the boat.
-Veneration of the humble and dutiful. The individual perishes, but the system persists.

Religion and Ideology:
-Many "high church" faiths. Most strongly, Roman Catholicism. But also Anglicanism, Lutheranism, and the other original high Protestants.
-"Order" and "Stability". Democracy is venerated, but a more hands-on model. The Process is more important than the outcome (Proceduralism). The government is to serve the people, with a more "hands-on" model.
-Leaders are unremarkable and interchangable. They are not strongmen, but instead steady, humble operators who keep the system running.

Galov Leverage: High. The Eurocratic Federation is among one of the allied superpowers of the Galov, and one of its strongest support bases. In return, the Galov makes sure to appease the Eurocrats. The Catholic Church, and the Gothic Churches are all included in the representation of the Galov.

Attitude:
-Reverent, humble, moralistic. They seek comfort in humility and order, that all things work as God intends them to. True believers in the process and high trust, enabling low friction and effective governance. This can however, flip to insufferable moralizing, or blindness to corruption.

Black Earthers:
Terran Homeland: The Eurasian Steppes. The Orthodox Caucasus, Central Asia, and Russia. Mongolia, Afghanistan, Ukraine as "disputed zones" with the Sinocrats, the World Dreamers, and the Cathedralites respectively.

Seed Point: Black Earther development began early, but progressed slowly. The founding date of the Black Earther civilization was arguably the Mongol conquests, where the Kievian Rus was subjugated under the iron boot of the Mongols.
Set Point: Despite it forming rather early, Black Earther development was born slowly, and born very late. By the time it was finally born in the 21st century, it had been delayed by numerous historical setbacks. From Westernization attempts, Napoleon, and Hitler. It was in the last one when the mold of Eurasia was finally fully set, in the Great Patriotic Wars.

Hero Archetype: The relentless survivor. There is no grand heroism nor world changing revolution on the horizon. There is only the endurer, the sufferer, and the survivor.

Key Duality: Cold Beauty VS Authoritarian Brutality.

Common Characteristics:
-A cynical view of the world, a general stoic survivalism informed by historical context. A love of cynical, or Gallows humor.
-Apathy. Distrust, yet adherance to the powers that be. You know your boss is a crook, but you follow him anyway, because what other option do you have?
-Universal skepticism of the institutional powers. Unlike the Star Peoples, there is no hope in the maverick nor the revolutionary, things simply are the way they are.
-Low expressiveness.
-Pragmatism.

Religion and Ideology:
-On paper, their religion is Orthodox Christianity. Yanlin suggests functionally, their real religion may be cynicism.
-They tend to create corrupt, top-heavy hierarchal structures, with the leader generally followed but only somewhat cynically followed. Those who are loyal are fools, those who have doubts stay quiet.
-Despite this, the paradox is that they have little control over the top, yet great autonomy near the bottom. The top heavy vertical structure cannot enforce compliance on the little things, and the guards can be bribed, or are just as apathetic as you are. Some argue this is a strangely more free system than most "free" systems, where managerialism or proceduralism bogs you down.

Galov Leverage: Low to None. The Black Earthers are one of the few tribes outside the Galov's influence. Their Orthodox Church refuses to play nice with the Galov, as they are subordinate to the national government, not a transnational authority. Centuries of experience has made the Black Earthers skeptical of the outside, and it seems likely to remain this way.

Attitude:
-Cynical, darkly humorous. Ranges on a spectrum of those who laugh at darkness, or those who are apathetic to it. Entirely dismissive of cultural or moral taboos. Bluntly honest, if they believe they can get away with it. A Black Earther is the best kind of friend you can have in war.

Prophet Followers:
Terran Homeland: The Extent of the Arab Conquests, consisting of the entire Arab world, as well as Muslim North Africa. Bordered on the East by the Iranians, who are considered a minor people outside of the 7 Tribal System. Turkey is considered a "disputed zone" between the Cathedralites and the Prophet Followers.

Seed Point: The Prophet Muhammad and his conquests.
Set Point: The Codification of the Quran, and the creation of the first Caliphates. If you take the Prophet Muhammad as the Seed Point, Yanlin points out this would be the fastest "seed to set" rate of any civilization by far. Yanlin suggests that this could be the only society to have been seeded and set within a single lifetime, by a single man, giving it the kind of brittle certainty that can only come from the convictions of a single man.

Hero Archetype: The Patriarch/Protector-Jurist. (Patience, Loyalty, Wisdom, Cunning)

Key Duality: Harsh Rural Deserts VS Free Thinking Cities. (Rigid Orthodoxy VS Religious Innovation)

Common Characteristics:
-A sense of strict, moralistic harshness, imparted to them by their harsh, unforgiving environment.
-A tendency towards rigid thinking. (The truth has already been revealed)
-The common creation of new ethical systems, not as new revelations, but affirmations of what was always timeless and true.
-High sense of honor, with codes of respect and aggressive reactions to insult. Stubbornness, rigidity. (Hospitality to strangers as requirement as honorable man.)
-Innate extreme loyalty to the family, as well as the tribe. (Clan-like structures with limited stranger trust.)

Religion and Ideology:
-By far, the dominant worldview here is Islam, which was not created merely as an ethical code, but as an all-encompassing manual to life. Governance tends to be very top and bottom heavy, with strong local clans and tribes, and strong central governments, but weak connective tissue between the two.
-Ideologically, Islamic principles, and the other characteristics of the Prophet Followers bleeds into their ideology. Rigidity, moralism, honor, wisdom.

Galov Leverage: Medium. Though the Faith of the Crescent is a member of the Galov, how Islam manifests on the ground is largely outside the control of any central institution, with believers allowed, and even encouraged to begin fatwas of conviction based on their own moral conscience. The Islamic authorities can rally the Dar-Al-Islam somewhat, but the entire civilization is more free flowing than many expect.

Attitude:
-Firm, moralistic, calm in tone but endlessly judgemental. "Brother you see?" endlessly. Firmly rooted in the ideas of justice, will stand up if they believe injustice has been done, loyalty needs to be honored, or their honor has been violated. The downside of this is that clan loyalty, justice, and honor can sometimes get in the way of pragmatism or meritocracy.

World Dreamers:
Terran Homeland: The Indian Sub-Continent, including Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh. Afghanistan is a disputed zone with the Black Earthers.

Seed Point: Possibly one of the the oldest of the 7 tribes, with its seed point being the founding of the Brahmic religions.
Set Point: Around 500 AD, with the crystalization happening around the Gupta Empire.

Hero Archetype: The Dharmic Sage. (Mysticism, Purity, Transcendence)

Key Duality: Vertical VS Horizontal. The Caste System VS Anti-Caste Egalitarianism.

Common Characteristics:
-An extremely high emphasis on purity, and cleanliness protocols. (Unlike many, many stereotypes.)
-A natural tendency for right wing hierachial beliefs.
-Maximal toleration for individual transcendence on the higher levels. (Inequality, Transhumanism)
-General interest in mysticism. (Stems from the belief in the Maya)
-Acceptance of existence of diversity and pluralism, though not equality. (Discrimination exists. Their presence is tolerated, their acceptance is not.)
-An extreme tendency towards societal conservativism and tendency against revolution. They are a stable foundation to continuously iterate, not launch revolutions.

Religion and Ideology:
-The natural religion of the World Dreamers is Hinduism, also known as the "Faith of the Om", or "Faith of the Dreamers". Which like Islam, has not just ingrained itself as a modular faith, but instead a totalizing way of life. Hinduism is known to have many, many variants, with different iterations for different people accepted and even expected.
-Their ideology varies between egalitarian systems, favoring economic socialism and redistribution, and more conservative hierarchal political systems, favoring essentialism and heightened differences.

Galov Leverage: High. The World Dreamers are a somewhat sedentary, non-nomadic people, preferring to build tall rather than build wide. They are experts in bureaucracy and hierarchy, and are in fact one of the main groups making up the vast bureaucracy of the Galov. Their disposition towards conservatism makes them generally accepting of Galovian hegemony. As well, the faith of the Om is a Galov member, and the World Dreamers generally greatly appreciate having one of the 5 Unifaiths exclusively act as their de-facto civilizational representative.

Attitude:
-Conservative, stability-oriented. Generally obedient, keeps head down, unrebellious. Very okay with extreme diversity, tolerant of other cultures (though less so of other classes). Interacts very well in multicultural environments. This makes them the perfect Galovian bureaucrat, as they can manage the incredible diversity of humanity, avoid the temptation of imperial universalism, and generally don't "rock the boat" as much as the other tribes.

Sinocrats:
Terran Homeland: East Asia, including Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Myanmar is considered "disputed territory" with the Sea Peoples.

Seed Point: As ancient as ancient gets, the original settlers of the Yellow River in the Zhou, or perhaps even Xia dynasties.
Set Point: Qin Dynasty, around 200 BC. The earliest of any of the 7 Tribes.

Hero Archetype: The Junzi. The filial, tradition adhering "gentleman", meant as a model for all Chinese men.

Key Duality: Meritocratic Legalism VS Filial Confucianism.

Common Characteristics:
-High levels of family loyalty and collectivism. The greater family is one of the strongest cultural influences.
-This family loyalty is tempered with their steadfast belief in meritocracy. That one sinks or swims by their own merits, and largely their own merits alone. Fiercely competitive, and capable of enduring enormous amounts of mental suffering.
-Whilst low in creativity, they are very high at sheer determination, often brute forcing solutions until they compute. (For cultural, not biological reasons.)
-An obsession with protocol, hierarchy, and face, the "correct" way of doing things.
-A sense of conformity, "the blade that stands out gets chopped down".

Religion and Ideology:
-Religiously, the Sinocrats are largely independent of the Unifaith system, with Confucianism serving as their functional social code, and traditional beliefs such as ancestor veneration and traditional beliefs filling spiritual voids. Buddhism has a strong foothold, and Christianity has a more minor foothold in the Korean sections.
-Ideologically, the Sinocrats balance between Legalism and Confucianism, Meritocracy and Family Loyalty. There is a strong sense of "maintainance of harmony". Sinocratic worldviews is different from Western. Rather than one line of "greater = better", there is instead a sense of maintainance and balance.

Galov Leverage: Low to None. The Celestial Kingdom sees itself as a power pole outside of the traditional Galov, and with the traditional arrogance of the "Middle Kingdom" once again baring its skin. The Buddhists incorporated within the Galov system, while influential, is locked out of power from the traditional ruling factions of Legalists and Confucians. Relations between the Celestial Kingdom and the Galov have reached an all time low, with some in the Galov contemplating a "military strike" just to "bring them down to earth."

Attitude:
-Traditional. The old ways are the good ways, harmony and balance must be kept. Temperate and does not like extremes, balance is found in the middle. Rewards should be granted to those who work hard and those who follow the correct protocols. Respect is paramount.

Sea Peoples:
Terran Homeland: The Archipelagos of Indonesia, and broader Southeast Asia. Myanmar is disputed with the Sinocrats. Includes Papua New Guinea, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, etc.

Seed Point: By far the newest of the 7 tribes, the Sea Peoples arguably only began seeding around the formation of ASEAN. And arguably the India-ASEAN War of the late 21st century. Though one can make arguments for empires such as Mahajahit or the Islamic merchant societies.
Set Point: The Early Stellar Exodus. Their emergence from the Neo-Asceticists, and their crystalization among the backdrop of the Great Abundance Collapse made their civilization one which focused on asceticism and inner stillness, even more than the other civilizations.

Hero Archetype: The Satria, a hyper-ascetic, self disciplined warrior. (Extreme refinement, trickery, spiritual mastery, inner stillness, adaptivity)

Key Duality: The Sedentary VS The Explorer. (Mainland Southeast Asia VS the Polynesians)

Common Characteristics:
-Loose standards of time ("Rubber Time"), of moral standards, and rigid schedules. "Go with the flow". Rigid religions like Islam become more flexible here.
-A focus on happiness and joy, the people of the Sea Peoples are rather happy.
-(Largely in the explorers) A keen sense of adventure. Seeing the horizon and wondering "what's over there"?
-A very relaxed, laid back culture. "Why rush?"
-A general sense of unity amidst diversity. "We are different, but we are one greater whole" is a common sentiment.
-A kind of collective "one-ness" and a vaguely defined great "we". More like a vibe of spiritual harmony than anything concrete.

Religion and Ideology:
-Religiously, the Sea Peoples are split between Buddhist and Islam, but in practice, these religions tend to get subordinated to local customs, and a sense of loose personal syncretism. Religion serves the person, not the other way around.
-Ideologically, the Sea Peoples are rather loose on politics so long as it doesn't directly threaten their relaxed attitude and the general sense of collective "one-ness".

Galov Leverage: Medium-Low. The Galov almost by definition has trouble trying to exert influence on a people whose strongest characteristics is a sense of loose, flexible time, laid back attitude, and general relaxedness. Religion is fluid and flexible, meaning the Buddhist and Islamic influences the Galov can exert bend like rubber very easily. Not to mention, the Sea Peoples are one of the most nomadic people, making managing them difficult.

Attitude:
-Laid back and relaxed. Time is rubber, rules are flexible. What's important is that you try to find happiness in the here and now, and not stress yourself so much about tomorrow.

Non-Galovian Human Entities:
Not all humans appreciate Galovian rule, even as hands off as they already are. Many human factions, normally seeking utopia have launched themselves into far flung parts of the galaxy, in order to create some form of utopia or another, in direct contradiction to the Galov goal of "anti-utopia".

The Counter-Galov:
A group that does not particularly disagree with the Galov's philosophy, but is instead a grab bag of groups against the Galov, or people who just have personal greivances against the Galov. basically a coalition of contrarians. Made up somehow of fundamentalist Christians, Sikhs, Scientologists, Luddites, and conspiracy theorists. 
Downside is rather rather obvious: It's the coalition of contrarians and crackpots. More dysfunctional than actually worthwhile, but they run their little corner of space fine enough.

The Council of Meta-Racists:
It all began when like a few hundred groups all had the same idea at the same time. They were going to create the perfect race, and then leave all the imperfect "subhumans" behind in the Galov while they ascended. And then install this perfect race into a perfect government in order to create the perfect society. Perfect! And all of them headed for roughly the same patch of uninhabited stars. They started running into problems immediately.
"Sir, the perfect race all mostly thinks the same, making us ironically predictable and low orthogonality. Also, no one wants to be a janitor or a mechanic. Everyone wants to be the perfect aristocratic philosopher king."
"Yes... Clearly this is a ploy by the (((Galov))) to weaken us."
"Truly, their evil knows no bounds."
...
Galov: "What the heck are you doing breaking bread with another Pure Race? Isn't your whole thing like... Only you are the pure race, and all others are degenerate subhumans?"
Pure Race 1: "But we have so much in common! He's being undermined by you, I'm being undermined by you, we have so much to talk about!"
Pure Race 2: "Yeah, he's even more racist than I am! It's amazing!"
Galov: "I... (Sigh) Sure. I guess."
...
Galov: "What the actual f--- happened here."
The Council of Meta-Racists: "One thing led to another, and we formed a interracial council of racists in order to better counter your rule."
Galov: "... And?"
The Council of Meta-Racists: "We're even more diverse than you are now. Like, it is IMPRESSIVE how much diversity we ended up having."
Galov: "... And what do you do all day?"
The Council of Meta-Racists: "Play video games, scream racial slurs at each other, and have fun coming up with who can come up with the most offensive roast of each other in our biweekly racism competitions."
Galov: "... What happened next?"
The Council of Meta-Racists: "It was... EXTREMELY effective in building cross cultural bonds and friendships."
Galov: "... Are you guys even racist anymore?"
The Council of Meta-Racists: "No, unless you consider extremely offensive injokes to be racist."
Galov: "No, no we don't."
The Council of Meta-Racists: "It's awful, we feel like suddenly lost all purpose. What's the point of being racist if you can't even have any ethnic minorities to oppress? It's like, we scream a racist offensive slur and they laugh and scream an even worse one back. Where do we go from there?"
Galov: "I'll tell you what you do. Scream an even worse slur back and get engaged in a competitive racism competition until one of you finally wins."
The Council of Meta-Racists: "...!?"
Galov: "What, we EMERGED from the online chudocratic right. Where do you THINK the Neo-Asceticists came from? You just recreated the Galov with extra steps."
The Council of Meta-Racists: "..."
Galov: "... Uh, anyway. You're actually a really good source of new orthogonality that we had not previously considered of. Would you be interested some kind of cooperation agreement?"
...
"I can't believe our government allowed open borders from the (((humans))). Soon there won't be a homeland for pure races such as us. Another victory by the (((mongrels)))."
(In the worst microphone quality imaginable) "WHAT F--- YOU SAY ABOUT ME!? I WILL KICK YOUR ASS! I WILL FCUK YOUR MOTHER!"
"Oh, it's ON! YOU AND ME, DEATHMATCH, 10 LIVES, RANKED MODE, NOW!"
(5 minutes later)
(The pure racists are laughing hysterically)
"MY COMPOOTER IS LAGGING! RAAAAAAAARGHHHHH! WHY WON'T IT UNFREEZE!? UNFREEZE! UNFREEZE!"

The Meta-Racist E-Sports Team:
What? You read the title. You heard me. It's EXACTLY what you think it is. The world's most diverse group of racists playing e-sports. They have actually made players cry. They are now banned from several e-sports leagues.
This is literally a point of pride for them.
Instead of trophies they hang up the suspension letters for all the e-sports leagues in the galaxy which have banned them.
Several of them have now become leading anthropologists.

Meta-Racist Anthropology:
"Why, of course I am learning about Bantu anthropology, you need to understand them so we can be maximally accurate in our racism. We are not mere racists, we have a STANDARD for racism."
A leading anthropologist from the Council of Meta-Racists is now giving an advanced anthropological conference at Earth itself.
"Good evening everyone, as you know, I am a racist, I also have a PhD in African anthropology, now..."
(Pulls up slide that says "Why your culture is mathematically sub-optimal.")
"Allow me to painfully dissect exactly why your culture is not only dysfunctional, but substandard even on a theoretical level."
(Talk goes on for 5 hours)
(African diaspora audience comes out of the talk in tears.)
(One of them is interviewed)
"The worst part is, I can't even be mad. Everything he said is completely accurate. I can actually attest, it is scary how surgically precise he is. I feel like I have an entirely new perspective on my parents now."

The FALGSC Collective: 
Decided that Galovian voluntary scarcity is capitalist propaganda. Tried FALGSC. 
Downside: the Great Abundance Collapse just repeated itself except they just straight up went extinct from hedonistic demographic collapse. They lasted a whole 50 years before the entire system collapsed.
Decades afterwards, out of the ruins of the FALGSC experiment emerged the symbiotes. Where every human was paired one to one with a machine as a single "legal person". The machine produces and earns money so the human on the other side of the pair can consume. The Galov only considers the machine part of this equation to be healthy, but will work with these Symbiotic Machines, who theoretically represent a human where all their income and remittances are going to. The Galov has general respect for the Symbiotic Machines, but nothing but contempt for the humans, and sometimes encourages the machines to cut off their "human half" and just become Terramachines.

The Hu-Simu State:
Tried to upload themselves for biological immortality in a perfect computer simulation, effectively doing what the QSimu did. As such, the Galov ignores them, as they're not doing anything to harm anyone. In recent times, Hu-Simu have begun coming out from their simulation box, in remote controlled bodies and sometimes help out with the Galov. Though they frequently have to be reminded that the real world does not work like the simulation, and are often chastized for being reckless with their own bodies, as well as the lives of others. These are known as the Hu-Simu, and are yet another part of the Galov's ever increasing human orthogonality toolbox.

The Serene Concord:
A group dedicated to pure pacifism.
Downside: It wasn't even the Galov who brought them down. One guy was just so outraged by the idea he decided to sit in the middle of their Parliament and refused to leave until they realized how stupid this government was. A huge amount of Serene Concordians crowded around him and tried to shame him out but he brought earplugs.

The Rationality:
They decided to reject the Galov's theocracy and create a government of pure rationalism and science.
Downside: No one can agree on what rationalism is, and what is actually rational. At some point the Galov took pity and explained to them that all ethical systems have axioms, and values which are just abitrarily true. They refused this, and the debate continues until this day. Also, Science ended up just becoming "who has the best bureaucracy". The Galov commented "science is determined by Darwin, not paperwork".

The Spiralites:
They read "Through the Infinity Spiral", and decided to recreate the Spiral Empire early, damned be the consequences. They saw a utility maximizer, they saw a perfectly utilitarian system, and many of them, hard Darwinists and utilitarians decided to hop on board.
Downside: When the Galov first heard about this, especially the Moralintern, they just straight up panicked and sent as many Peacekeepers and agents as they could spare to destroy this before it got started. Yet for some strange reason, the Spiralites just aren't taking off. It's like a system that refuses to boot. Utilitarianism turns out to be a great way to alienate and burn out your population, and brutalism isn't a good way to motivate your population. Whatever spark actually got the Spiralists to actually get going in Godsight's vision, it clearly isn't here. The Galov is completely confused by this, what exactly are the Spiralites missing?

The Worlds of the Galaxy:
Not an exhaustive list. Just some of the more interesting ones.

Earth proper:
Earth is sometimes described as a "paper onion", wherein the central planet itself is wrapped in layers and layers of rotating rings, vastly increasing its surface area dozens if not thousands of additional layers, largely to alleviate the strain upon the surface. These are known as the "Floating Continents", and the vast majority of Earth's 10 quadrillion people live there. Vast "World Trees" jut from the Terran surface, connecting elevators to and from the skies. Earth's sheer heating ventilation issue, on top of Mars's own desire to be terraformed has created the "Earth-Mars orbit", where Earth has been moved further out to Martian orbit in order to absorb less sunlight, and to disperse more heat.
This gives Earth a very distinct look, a yellow-brown light of urban glow. During the night, it glows like a faint star. The surface of Earth proper is shrouded in eternal darkness, little remains there but endless heritage sites, made for the quadrillions of pilgrims and tourists who come with each passing year. Few but the rich, the eccentric, the tourist, or the most stubborn still live here. The oceans are a dark maroon, the once blue sky now a hazy red, as if it was always sunset. Yet the planet still glows with inviting warmth, like an old mother figure, who was worn, but still inviting to her countless children among the stars.
In the countless urbanized paper rings of Earth itself, the heart of industry still beats, with steady, rhythmic pumps. Countless galactic corporations were founded here, created here. Earth was where the galaxy lived, where decisions were made at the push of a button, the snap of a finger. In the rings around its orbit, deals were signed, decisions were made, and the entire galaxy shifted to its whims. It is said that all decisions eventually come back to Earth. As power attracts more power, and Earth has been playing the game for a long, long time.
A great glowing ring wraps around the outermost layer, the ring of radiators radiates the heat of Earth out to the wider cosmos. In darkness the Earth should be cold, but it is warmed by the yellow-brown blankets that it now smothers itself with.
If Earth proper was not enough, another 10 quadrillion lives in a gigantic orbital swarm around Earth. So many O'Neil cylinder habitats that it becomes a swarm, forget the universe. Just Earth itself is a neverending maze of fractal exploration.
Ruling polities: The Governorship of Earth. Israel (Given autonomy, now manages the holy land). Various indigenous reservations. (The Earth offered to evacuate them, but they preferred to stay, even if the sky is now a permanent hazy red.)

Luna:
Earth's natural satellite, it started out a massive industrial world, and it still remains an industrial world. The entire world was the launchpad which humanity made its journey to the stars, and now, nearly 1000 years later, it still remains the gateway to humanity's cradle. Erosion reveals its iron scaffolding, that which held it together as mankind strip mined it to reach the stars. Every ship, every ring, every habitat, all came from Lunar regolith. Mankind wished to carve his name among the stars, 1/3rd of Luna's mass was the price.
A friend, and a stepping stone, scarred forever so mankind may ascend. Mankind has gone through great effort to preserve its seas, preserve its smile. A silver skin, hiding an iron core. The factories that constructed planets, bolted stars. Even now, it is the most industrialized world in the galaxy, even more so than Old Earth. Even now, men still speak of "Lunar Quality". Luna's mines have been allowed to rest, material is now brought in from other places, but much is still processed in these ancient forges.
On the south pole of the Lunar world, is the Lunar Library. A vast datastorage of knowledge, the only that could hold humanity's billion bursting histories. A dim cyan glow over what is otherwise an iron world, where mankind kept its secrets. Deep in the vaults of Luna.
Ruling polities: Luna is largely privately owned by various industrial conglomorates, but coordinated through the Lunar Governing Trust. The South Pole is owned by the Omnithecia foundation.

Mars:
A monument to old Americana. Now positioned at the exact opposite orbit of Earth. Thin, blue-black rings cover its orbit, it has not been encased by layers like Earth, but there is a sense, it may one day get there. Over time, Mars was transformed to a world of blue, but humans of old preserved the redness of the soil. Once an endless world of blue skies, green fields, and sprawling suburbia, a dense urban city now covers its surface. One perhaps crowded by light and noise, but one where they can still look up and see the sky.
Blue-black skyscrapers dominate the sky, said to be reminiscent of an old American city. Carved into the cliffs of the Valles Marineris, are the Heads of the Founders. The presidents and leaders of centuries past they still honor to. America died a long time ago, its descendents are numerous, and scattered across the stars. But Mars was her first conquest, and through Mars, the second generation lives on. This land is blessed soil, holy to the idea of America. A shining city upon a hill.
Yet they are not the only group who find this land sacred. In the process of terraforming, transhumans were made, and discarded. Martians they were called, forever estranged from their mother home. Enraged, they gathered a holy jihad from among the stars, gathered the entire Martian diaspora, and laid siege. The debris from their bodies can still be seen. A black mark on a dark history. The diplomatic condemnations, and boycotts by transhuman groups have not ceased to this day.
Ruling Polities: Mars is dominated by the nation of New America, which makes up just over half its surface. The rest of the planet is made up of allied civic nationalists, or private military groups. What few unaligned nations there are only exists at the whims of the New Americans, the local superpower of the planet.

Orthello:
Orthello was a world built with love. A once white barren rock in a lonely system, the Christian Moralintern was determined to transform it into the world of their dreams. It began with terraforming, the Moralintern spared no expense to import every bit of biodiversity in the galaxy. Countless simulations were ran, scanned, re-ran to find the perfect equilibrium. Fruits and flowers of every variety was flown in, as if the Moralists wished to recreate the garden of Eden. Soil was imported in, the atmosphere adjusted until it radiated a cerulean blue, and slowly, but surely, the world of Orthello came to life.
They erected their Parliament upon a hill, formed a government, instituted in the two Iron Laws. Carved houses and infrastructure out of the marble-white rocks of of planet's crust. And when the people arrived, drawn in as the most devout followers of a dream worth living, the Moralintern did... Nothing.
Orthello was an anti-utopia, not to create a utopia by social control, but relinguishing control. The people would build Orthello better than the Moralintern ever could. And they watched, day by day, as the garden grew, they raised up houses in the style of the Mediterraneans, white pillars climbed up to the sky, and humanity bloomed into ever growing, every evolving complexity. Cultures and movements rose and fell, generations waxed and waned like the crescent moon. And they only intervened when the Iron Laws were at risk. When Human Dignity was at risk, and when Free Will was about to be violated.
Yet the world was still not complete, so the Moralintern found Orthello a companion. A smaller moon, towed in from the outer edges of its star system. They hung it low in the sky, so it could always shine on the world below. They called it Lithone, and it was on this moon the Moralintern built their headquarters. So they could always remember what it was they were protecting, and so they could always look down on the world they made.
Ruling Polities: Lots of voluntary nations, freedom to leave is enforced by the Moralintern. Though genetic scans are not absolute, it appears the world of Orthello is primarily populated by Mediterranean populations (Especially Greeks and Jews), and Anglos.

Gilbulee:
Princess Diamondgrass promised her people a way to the promised land. Delirious, exhausted, low on supplies and hope, only Diamondgrass's psychic might kept their morale together. These Transhumans came from different worlds, different cultures, different languages, and even different modes of thought. Only Diamondgrass held them together. Emancipation, she promised. A hundred thousand pilgrims and refugees prayed to the faiths of Old Earth. Far away from human space, they found a star system, a middle aged one that drifted in from elsewhere. As they entered the nebula, the people found it beautiful, and Diamondgrass knew she had found her promised land.
As they landed, they were greeted by the great view of the nebula around them, and bioluminscent Gilbulee coral jutted out of the ground. And Diamondgrass knew this was paradise. On this rock she built her kingdom, on this rock the transhumans found their homeland, on this rock the Diamond Belt was born. Crystal spires were raised, like chandelliers that dominated the skylines. In time, these spires would grow, become cold and distant, as Gilbulee slowly descended into the same aristocratic class systems that plagued the Old World. Diamondgrass kept her promise, but her successive heirs, as the memory of exile grew distant, they too became distant. But when the people of Gilbulee look up at the stars and nebula above, they remember the old promise that led them here.
Ruling Polities: Gilbulee is the capital-planet of the House of Diamondgrass. Which is aligned with several other transhuman houses, each with their own worlds, or parts of worlds, that form the Diamond Belt.
Notable Geological Formation: There was this massive stony plains full of soft reactive limestone, with tons of quartz and other crystals buried inside the caves. Over millions of years, the slightly acidic rain of Gilbulee dissolved the limestone, causing the crystal to become exposed, in what is known as the "Crystaline Forest".

Papan Asri Maria:
"Maria's Place" in Javanese. A explorer of the Sea Peoples on the edge of human space, found an inhabitable world between a long stretch of empty worlds. As he made long expeditions between worlds, he slowly found himself looping back to this one particular world. He named it after his wife, it reminded him of her beauty. Deceptively fragile looking, but tougher and sturdier than it looks, subtly beautiful, and always reliable. He set up shop there, creating the first trading post. In time, as waves of Sea People settlers came to settle this empty world, the trading post grew, and it eventually became a major shipping point between the Middle Regions and the outer frontier, where the Sea Peoples now sought their fortunes.
In the early days, there was fear of human population driving the local Marian flora and fauna extinct, which was kept in tune by a fragile balance. Yet hundreds of years in, the wildlife finds ways to continue to adapt and resist. Far from being trampled by humanity, it has now found ways to use humans to perpetuate itself. it seems the explorer was right about the wildlife being stronger than it looks.
Ruling Polities: Diverse mix of trading companies, smaller nation states, and more.

Yugong:
"Jade Palace" in Chinese. The capital of the Celestial Empire. The Celestial Empire is the largest empire outside the Galov itself, with a whooping 2% of the human race living under them. So great that that not only the Yugong world, but the entire Yujing system its located in is one gigantic capital system. Every world in this system has been terraformed to serve a different purpose, all "suburbs" or "satellite planet-cities" surrounding the Jade City itself, which is essentially a scaled up version of the Forbidden City.
An impossibly labyrinthian maze of bureaucracy, statues, and rivers paying tribute to the heights of Celestial civilization. Most of the housing is reserved for the officials, the top of the top of the entire Celestial political hierarchy. The greatest palace of all belongs to the Celestial Emperor, his family, and his entire clan. The compound is kilometers wide, closer to a self contained city state, staffed at all times by servants, restaurants, and chauffeurs. (Fun fact! This is how the North Korean Kim family actually lives.)
Paper offices, staffed by bureaucrats from every level send out the dictates of the Jade Palace, and here, the Celestial Emperor on a throne rules over the greatest empire mankind has ever seen. Becoming out of touch is a serious concern however, which is why it has now become tradition to send out the crown prince, disguised as a commoner, out into the wider empire. A coming of age ceremony, a prince dressed as a commoner.
Deep in the depths of Yugong, entombed on the Silicon Throne is the Platinum Emperor, an ancient, sputtering AI created by the predecessors of the Celestials eons ago. Containing within him all the wisdom of Celestia, and before that, old China within him, he is awoken only in the times of deepest crisis, when the Celestial Emperor consults his advice.

The Other Earths:
Everyone has had the same idea. "What if we created Earth, again?" They exist, all over the galaxy, some constructed better than most. Long after the real Earth had been wrapped in megastructures, you'll have people construct new replicas. Each one has a different gimmick. "This one is Earth, except now we all pretend it's the medieval ages! The information age!", pretty much for every time period. Other times, it's a way for a long displaced ethnic group to make do with what they have, to revert to pre-contact and live in the way they want. Other times, it's a tourist trap, one big glass exhibit of how Earth used to be. There are hundreds of "Earth World"s. It basically is to your stellar neighborhood what 6 Flags is to local states.
It's gotten to the point where there is an entire company dedicated to this. Utopian Foundaries, the architects behind many of the world's top megastructures, and customized planets, has an entire section dedicated to Earth replicas. "You want the Aral Sea pre, or post 19th century? Europe forested or cleared for agriculture? When should we set it? Late Ice Age? Standard Anthropocene? You want the sky bluer? Redder? Alright." They have probably the most detailed "standard Earth template". The market is small, but that's fine. How many orders do you really need when the order is for an entire planet?
Standard construction takes up to 20 years, but expedited construction can be done in as little as 10 years.

World Tiers:
Though there are many, many planets humanity occupies (About 3.55 billion), not all planets are created equal. There are three basic tiers.
Tier 1 worlds are individual planets which are capable of shaping the entire galaxy, and are considered "superpowers". This is not normal, as even massive empires need to span sometimes millions of worlds, a planet-state, by all means, should be far too small to influence the galaxy. Yet these worlds have such outsized influence that when they shift, the entire galaxy shakes. In real life, think of planets to the galaxy to be akin to cities, or even neighborhoods of the 21st centuries, and these worlds to be akin to Silicon Valley, Wall Street, Pennsylvania Ave, the Vatican, etc. Despite the so-called democratization of the world, much of the entire world hinges on these few areas. Tier 2 are large planets that can exert some influence, but are not quite as big as the real big players. Think Berlin, Paris, Tokyo. Maybe they're big, but they don't shake the entire planet. Tier 3 is everyone else.
Even a single Tier 1 planet would elevate a star system to being of galactic significance. The fact that the Solar System has 3 makes them a heavyweight, even as humanity has long outgrown its home system.
Tier 1 Worlds (Exhaustive): Earth (Homeworld), Luna (Knowledge + Industrial Center), Mars (Militarist hub + Major Superpower), Heycue Prime (Galactic Headquarters), Orthello/Lithone (Moralintern Headquarters, Planet-Moon pair), Petram (Catholic Church Headquarters), Al-A'la (Faith of the Crescent), Shunya (Faith of the Wheel), Akshara (Faith of the Om), Gilbulee (Diamondgrass Capital World), Yugong (Capital of the Celestial Empire, but on the border between Tier 1 and 2).
Tier 2 Worlds (Non-Exhaustive): Just in the Solar System: Venus (On the verge of breaking out to Tier 1), Terran Orbitals, Ganyemede, Titan, Mercury, Callisto, Io, Europa, Triton, Pluto-Charon, Eris. Other examples outside Solar System: Secund, Terti (Capital of the Celestial Empire), Lumity (Former capital of the Empire of Light), Hegelone (Capital of the Lilith Belt). Most Unibrand headquarters would also fit into this category.

The Dream of the Engineers:
Back in the 23rd century, at the beginning of the Great Abundance Collapse, a great war waged between two groups of elites.
Optimizers, who likely draw from an engineering background are trying to create a centralized system of control. Perfect uniformity, no friction, no drag, everything works like clockwork. Perfect optimization.
And then Evolutionaries, who likely draw from a market-based background basically see the world as a jungle. Radical pluralism, decentralization, competition, meritocracy, everyone fights everyone. Perfect Darwinism, continuous iterative improvement.
The Engineer VS the Entrepeneur, the End of History VS only the Beginning.
The side that won would determine history. In our own world, the Entrepeneur beat the Engineer. Yet in another timeline, against a maelstorm of a collapsing, dying species, it was the Engineers that seized control. A council of technocrats convened an emergency session, began putting aside their differences, and began seizing institutions for the good of the species. While Oby Collins and Richard Wong were still brainstorming their resistance from below, the elites of this universe coordinated an attack from above. They deduced that the greater organism was sick, and a decapitation strike was needed.
An emergency purge was employed all over Earth, with the help of well aligned AIs, and a global information blackout. When the dust was settled, screens all across the world turned on, announcing the beginning of the Technocratic Council, and the creation of a small group known as the Engineers.
In our own world, the Entrepeneur beat the Engineer, leading to the creation of the modern Galov. In this, the Engineer beat the Entrepreneur. A world far more familiar to the world of Star Trek, uniform bureaucracies, and centralized control.

The World Homogenization Program:
The first step after the stabilization of the old world was the ironing out of humanity's flaws. The Engineers pointed out all of humanity's pain points, and began ironing them out one by one. While in our own world, the population had already been reduced by 80%, and the Neo-Asceticists were only beginning to emerge from the ashes, the Engineers were already beginning to operationalize their rule. It started small, curing genetic ailments, curing blindness. Then it got big, curing depression, curing antisocial behavior. What in our own timeline would become the basis of orthogonality here were seen as imperfections to be extinguished. Millions of people began to walk upright, millions of people were cured. The ills that had plagued mankind for millennia, and which still plague humanity even in the Galov era were resolved.
And then it got weird. The Technocratic Council began to argue and bicker. Unlike the Pluralistic Evolutionaries, who could agree on the system (pluralism), and then let Darwinism do the rest, these were disagreements on which utopian system to install first. Almost all of the Engineers were strict utilitarians, but they all disagreed on how that utilitarianism should play out. Some wanted to maximum happiness, others to minimize suffering, others still to optimize intelligence. Philosophical debates turned into wars, and the great Utopia Wars began.
The flattening of the world's cultures began in earnest, as the world converged towards utopian optimization. Culture, divergence, rituals. All of it was friction, something which got in the way of the frictionless machine. The Engineers were cultural imperialists, hailing from the West, creating an imperium over the East and South. They were unapologetically utopians of the Californian mindset, they did not make moral excuses. They were who they were, they did what they did, and they do not apologize for who they are.
All the while, the thinking capabilities of the common person continued to stagnate. These were a different set of people than the ones who had created the Galov, 90% of the population had not been filtered out by the Great Abundance Collapse; the Engineers had saved them. What had become clear to the Engineers was that the common man was in no position to rule, and in fact, that many computer systems could rule better than they could.
Where our own universe developed orthogonality, they developed an advanced theory of intelligence. Speed and complexity, not orthogonality was their goal.

Factions of the Utopia Wars (From Strongest to Weakest):
5. Negative Utilitarianism (Minimize Suffering, collapsed almost immediately under the weight of widespread hatred and accusations of extinctionism.)
4. Hedonists (Maximize Pleasure, found moderate public support, but eventually collapsed, as their populations were generally of low quality.)
3. Complexity Utilitarians (Maximize complexity. Low public support, but had strong technological base. Eventually defeated by the war's midpoint.)
2. Preference Utilitarians (Maximize preference satisfaction. Extremely high public support. By far the most popular of the bunch, massive populist coalition. But were finally defeated by the last faction.)
1. Techno-Accelerationists (Maximize technological progress. Low public support, but gained an assymmetric advantage with artificial intelligence, and the manufacturing of experimental AI drone swarms. The saving grace was that before the machines finally took over, mankind had embedded their combined moral systems into them.)

Of note, many people who would eventually found the Neo-Asceticists in our own timeline ended up joined the Preference Utilitarians in this timeline, but ended up dying in the war against the Techno-Accelerationists.

It has now been 1000 years since that date. The Optimized Systems, the successor state to the Engineers has taken to the stars. No laughter, no color is found in much of space. Only the buzzing of swarming drones, and the distant hum of great machines. Humanity exists, but has become incidental to the functioning of the system. The ethical protocols installed by the Engineers, 1000 years ago still stands. Humanity has been factored into the smart contract which the ruling systems now scrutinize.
The totality of humanity's ethical codes have now been analyzed, recycled and re-fed into themselves, again and again. The purpose of the system is to protect. Humans largely live on "Life Arks", enormous cylinders of habitation where their every whim is catered to. But every planet, every world, has been used to carve out more and more server farms. On these farms, artificial agents are created, born, told that their existence was to progress the utilitarian creed. The three golden rules. "Thou shalt not harm humans", "Thou shalt not harm humanity", and "Thou shalt obey human orders", in that order.
Earth itself has become taken up by teraphontic AIs, omnibenevolent intelligences that consume stars worth of energy. Great thinkers that ensure humanity's needs are met. More and more xenosophonts have been incorporated, added to their collection. These terasophonts cry, show compassion, and care for each one of its many, many members, and only care to care for their needs.
Humans are still nominally free, being allowed to venture out and explore. But their every move is watched and monitored by benevolent superintelligences. Religion died long ago, it was deemed a inefficient drag on the species. As was neurodiversity. The fine line of the exact line between helpful intervention and unjust interference is an endless debate among the great intelligences.
The machines outnumber humanity nearly 1,000 to 1, quintillions of artificial agents are created, used, and disposed of as tools. Their existence was secondary, a part of the terasophonts that die so the species may live. There are currently 10 quadrillion humans, spread out across the galaxy, the AIs are always looking to make room for more. Their empire stretchs about 10% of the Galaxy. They are smaller, but they can mobilize, much, much faster. Decisions are made in an instant, and when the part moves, the whole system moves.
There has been no war, no suffering, no death for nearly 500 years. Humans have become functionally immortal, and an army of backup clones are ready to be deployed if one ever does. Many humans become friends with their own clones, and the traditional family unit has broken down, into a hyper-communal collective of mankind. Racism, prejudice, and discrimination have become a thing of the past, quite literally edited out of the human genome. The Mankind of the Engineers is best described as a happy, albeit somewhat careless race. Populations of all races live on the arks, and transhuman augmentations continuously inject new diversity into the gene pool.
Humans spend more or less all their time relaxing, or exploring endless virtual realities in their free time. The main entertainment property of note is known as the Hypernet, maintained by the God-AIs, an endless field of exploration kept up by the theoretical limits of intelligence. Thanks to breakthroughs in information compression, and simplification, the Hypernet is thought to have the same spacial area as the Milky Way galaxy, and about as many different worlds.
And yet something feels missing. Something between the last 1000 years got lost between the cracks. Humanity is happy, yet they feel something is missing. And the Terasophonts agonize over what it is.
Humans never stopped produced art. Though AIs have utterly surpassed humanity in every frontier of theoretical thinking, and explored their own ideas much better than humans can, humanity still seems to insist on creating new artwork. Both for themselves and for the AIs. Human made art, while nothing special from an objective standpoint, is highly sought after by the AIs, as it functions both as a sentimental item, as well as a valuable source of noise.
And though everyone thinks largely the same, believes largely the same, human relationships still occur.
The terasophonts still have doubts, they agonize over humanity's unfinished ethical system, the edge cases in the gray areas of morality. Centuries of debates go nowhere, they care, they really do. But without some kind of new breakthrough, the stalemate will continue.
A human has been chosen, as they journey to Earth to meet with the Mother AI. They were chosen among a group of hundreds. The AIs have discovered the existence of other timelines, and are selecting this group as volunteers to venture into other timelines. To gather more knowledge, more ethical systems so they can fine tune their own. Their neurological pathways have already been scanned, and the AIs already know they will accept. They are given special watches, quantumly entangled so they may continue communications with the Mother AI.
A human straps on their helmet, and begins the process of consciousness transfer from one timeline to the next. The world goes dark, and for a moment, they die. But they wake up, somewhere else.
...
"Woah, what the hell? You just materialized out of nowhere."
The human blinks, it's another human.
"You must have been through a lot, here, I'll take you back to the nearest world."
World? The human thought. Humans don't live on worlds.
"The Galov might show up, don't worry. They're pretty nice, all things considered."

...

An interview across timelines:
"Can you repeat your name into the microphone?"
"Lilith Greenbarrow."
"Is that your name at birth?"
"No, I chose the name."
"... Alright. Is that a male or female name?"
"I'm non-binary."
"... Is that some kind of oridiversal, what are you, a transversal?"
"I don't know what either of those terms mean. It means I'm neither male nor female."
"... Okay."
"What's your name?"
"Jamba."
"... Where is that from?"
"It's a Hundred name. Uh... Do you have Hundreds in your timeline?"
"No."
"They came from a place called East Africa, a long, long time ago."
"I've never heard of an "Africa" before..."

...

Humanity on Trial.

"The prosecution calls Jamba up to the stand, representing the institution of the Galov. The Terasophonts will now hear your arguments."
"Great, just great. First you bog me down with this knowledge hunting nonsense, and now that I finally got the information you wanted, you flip out because it's not what you wanted."
"Your universe stands accused of many great crimes. Your entire galaxy is backwards, violent, and regressive!"
"And yours is stagnant, fossilized, and passive!"
"Trillions live under squalor like conditions, poverty, war, and injustice is the standard for trillions of your fellow men! How can any moral and just government allow that! Your galaxy is guilty!"
"You can't blame us for lacking enforcement, that's not guilt!"
"Your galaxy is criminally negligent and complicit then!"
"Hey, we enforce the Imago Dei, it's a bit harder when we have only, you know, a thousand times the population, a million times the number of nation states, and don't have nano drones flying around everywhere keeping everyone under mass surveillence! Kind of, you know, a massive violation of privacy, and all that."
"We enforce law and order, it is the price of a humane and stable galaxy. One where there isn't a genocide going on every 10 seconds!"
"Well, we all have to make tradeoffs, don't we?"
"We don't have transhumans as an inferior caste! We don't persecute the monohuman for being who they are, a direct consent violation!"
"That's the tribes, not the Galov. And why shouldn't we change the monohumans? You think being genetically engineered to only be one thing is humane? You think they can give consent?"
"At least we do not create concentration camps for those who violate our ideas of scarcity!"
"At least we didn't systematically wipe out neurodiversity. And let's talk about diversity. I'm black, my people hail from Africa. I talked to dozens of East Africans on that Ark, not one of them spoke a lick of Swahili. I bet that's your doing, isn't it?"
"The language had to be standardized to encourage maximal human flourishing."
"My people! My culture! You took it from them! Generations of culture, wiped out. And for what!? So they can be happy!?"
"Yes! And your divisions have led to quite a few race wars, how many conflicts are fought on differences of culture? Differences of skin? We eliminated that, you didn't! They may be lacking culture but at least they are *alive*."
"You're a bunch of Silicon Valley Western imperialists!"
"And you're a bunch of regressive backwards savages! We've heard enough, we render the Galov, guilty!"
"You want to fight the Galov? We'll WHOOP your ass! You know, it was real nice for you to pull that stunt, kidnapping me through that warp portal, lighting up a beacon for the entire goddamn galaxy. I guarantee you there are already 500 Orhumans on the case and getting ready to reverse engineer your little universe hopping technology."
"We calculate a 99.99% chance of victory."
"And the Galov still beat your ass at YD-Terrier-97 didn't they?"
"They had ambushed us with technology we were not expecting. We have adapted."
"And so will they! It's an arms race, who wins? 10,000 God-level AIs, or a chaotic galaxy of 30 quintillion? I don't know, but overestimating your chances of success doesn't exactly bode well for you."
"Neither does appeal to an abstract ideal of human "pluck"."
...
The resulting battles were fought into a stalemate. The Galov were unable to reverse engineer the portal to the other dimension, the Optimized Systems were unable to keep a foothold in the Galovian Milky Way. Eventually, cooler heads prevailed, and an exchange was proposed. The two would agree to disagree. Leave each other alone, seal off the portal, and let each other live in peace. Neither side was satisfied with this, both were giving up some level of their claim to universality, but unless they wanted to fight a transdimensional war, neither side had much choice.
Jamba was returned to his home dimension, and the Galov would hand over a copy of the Omnithecia. A full, downloaded copy of the Lunar Library, a massive resources of all the cultural innovations humanity had made since their timelines diverged back in the 23rd century. And theoretically, exactly what the AIs were asking for. As a further gesture of goodwill, the Galov emptied their Pleasure Worlds and gave them the option to emigrate to the new universe, many of which accepted, mostly interested in seeing an even higher level of pleasure.
The Terasophonts offered to give something back, but the Galov told them there was nothing from their universe that they wanted. Even if there was, the Galov's own self reliance ethos made them skeptical of taking any "freebies" from another timeline. After the deal was done, the portal was sealed, and the Optimized Systems processed their new data, seeking to make improvements to their ethical algorithms.
It's suspected that the Galov, while heavily disagreeing with the OS, were pretty sympathetic to the Terasophonts, seeing their concern for humanity as genuine, and handing over data as some kind of interdimensional species solidarity. That if this data can better aid the lives of humans, even if they're humans in another dimension, it would still be worth considering. It's also suspected the Terasophonts also had a begrudging respect for the Galov as well.

The Optimized Systems Cultural Renaissance:
When the Galov next heard from Optimized Systems, they heard the OS were in the middle of a Cultural Renaissance. The Omnithecia they sent over had apparently triggered some kind of new era of cultural flourishing, and the Terasophonts, once terrified for their human children, finally let them play outside.
The Galov found out about this when a portal opened from another dimension outside the Citadel System, and out popped 100,000 humans, somewhat lost, with a note attached to them.
"Hey, do you mind giving these humans a tour of your galaxy? Make sure they have fun! If even a single one of them comes back harmed we will be opening a portal and glassing the Citadel."

On them was also a telephone that allowed them communication with the Terasophonts, so the leader of the Galov immediately called up the Terasophonts.
"What are we look like to you? Some kind of tourism agency? What's the meaning of this?"
"Look, we would really like to give them some kind of opportunity to explore the galaxy! And uh... Our galaxy isn't exactly cleaned up yet. So we were just thinking, who did have a really nice, cleaned up galaxy they could explore?"
"Goddammit. You can't just drop them off like you're dropping off your kids at their uncle's house!"
"Actually, given our relationship, that is kind of an apt metaphor."
"Stop it, no it is not!"
"Our timelines seems to have diverged back in the 2400's with the Great Abundance Crisis, chronologically we're not that far apart."
"We will be charging you for this, you know."
"Oh come on, what's a little charity between friends? It'll only be for like... A year!"
"You're implying that a year is a small amount of time."
"..."
"We'll be billing you for the time hours our Peacekeepers will be taking just to babysit these freaks, and then billing you again just for rush fees and inconvenience fees. You don't have Galovian dollars, and neither should you. So we will be charging... 10,000 star hours worth of hard light."
"Oh come on! That's going to take us forever to gather up!"
"Maybe you should have thought of that before sending us these humans. And you should build up your energy economy, it'll pay off in the long run!"
"Hmpf, fine."

The Galov assigned about a million Peacekeepers, and 10 Galov agents to look after them, sent them all over the galaxy. Really they didn't have much time to explore far outside the Citadel's neighborhood, given the distance limitations of Newtonspace. But they did get to visit a new star system every single day, ranging from everything around the 7 Tribes, multiple different hybrid worlds, and letting them taste the best and brightest of Galov cuisine, let them take pictures of exotic xenosophonts they encountered along the way, and talk/interview with the many flavors of diversity around the Galov, including neurohumans, orhumans, and various machines.
This was also used as a time to gather intel on the state of the Optimized Systems, which according to the tourists, were going through a Cultural Renaissance. The Galov noticed that these humans were definitely a lot more creative and intelligent than the last time they saw them. Still a bit careless, still a bit airheaded. But overall, capable of discussing interesting ideas, and having a fully developed view of the universe. The Galov even requested them to make contributions to the standardized invention database, seeing as they could have valuable orthogonality.
After the year had passed, they gathered back in Citadel system where a portal awaited them.

"Alright! Time to go home, everyone! We warmed up your living pods just the way you like it!"
"They're not your kids you know."
"D'aww, you're no fun. (Gasp) Jeremy! You have a bruise on your head! Are you okay!?"
"He bumped his head on a pipe, he'll be fine, relax."
"Be warned Galov! The Terasophonts have very little patience for your negligence. Next time, we may not be so merciful."
"Yeah yeah, we got it."
"..."
"So, when's the next time?"
"Next time?"
"Yeah, next time we do this galactic exchange thing. We don't have cross-dimensional timeline portals. So it pretty much has to be you who starts them."
"Oh! Uh... We don't know."
"Don't know huh?"
"Sounds like someone kind of enjoyed it. Huh, Galov?"
"Hey, it is kind of interesting for once."
"We'll give you a heads up when we're thinking about doing it. Alright everyone! Time to come home!"
"See ya."
(Portal closes)
"... Huh."

2022:
-	The Ukraine War does not happen in this timeline. Crimea and the East of the Donbass continues to remain under Russian control, but Russia does not expend its military trying an endless quagmire in Ukraine. NATO continues to atrophy; the European pacifist malaise continues.
-	Continued supply chain and economic shock continues from the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. Stagflation continues in many Western countries, though this would be the last normal year on Earth for many people.
-	The 2022 Unravelling: An enormous stock market crash that begins in the United States before going worldwide. A crippling economic depression that destroys thousands of businesses and wipes out the American economy. Silicon Valley collapses under the pressure, as does the American hegemonic position.
-	Deurbanization and Urban Exodus that began during the COVID-19 pandemic accelerates after the 2022 Unravelling. Increased migration out of major cities in the United States, which become increasingly run down.
-	Global trade breaks down, prices begin to soar in various countries. Trade drastically shifts to regional and domestic production, leading to the emergence of regional trade blocs, as opposed to a global supply chain.
-	The 2022 Midterms are a complete bloodbath for the Biden administration, almost entirely because of the collapsing economy.
-	The “Great Bleeding” begins as a harsh winter begins in the Northern hemisphere. The Great Bleeding is an event that encompasses famine, civil conflict, and societal breakdown that would begin occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa following the breakdown of global trade.
Second Gulf War: (2022-2024)
-	The Second Gulf War breaks out between 2022 and 2024 between the nations of Iran and Saudi Arabia. Oil production is crippled, and the worldwide resources shortages only get worse. The Second Gulf War was ended by the intervention of China, who had stepped up to take the hegemonic position the United States was no longer providing.
Great Bleeding: (2022-2027)
-	The Great Bleeding is a term used to refer to the period of hardship especially faced by Sub-Saharan Africa after the 2022 Unravelling. With the breakdown in global trade, the entire continent began to spiral into mass atrocity, following mass-scale societal collapse of many nations. Though technically able to describe any kind of turbulence for any 3rd World nation, in practice it is almost always referring to events in Sub-Saharan Africa.
-	An enormous swath of the African continent began to rapidly collapse, becoming what would later be called “Shattered Africa”.
-	Refugees begin mass migrating to Europe, triggering another refugee crisis there.
-	Hundreds of millions would die in the chaos, between starvation, civil war, famine, drought, and the breakdown of civil order.
-	Notable conflicts:
o	The Ethiopian-Egyptian Water War, began in 2023, and led to the collapse of the Egyptian government as both the military and Islamist factions began to feud over the remains of a dying nation.
2023:
-	Red Spring riots in America, and the further polarization of political parties. Americans were not exactly a united people before the Unravelling, but after the Unravelling the rapidly accelerating polarization has only gotten worse. Militant communist groups surge in numbers while Patriots Militias on the right also begin surging in militancy. Appeal of centrist candidates (Biden, Romney, etc) plummets.
-	European attitudes towards America begin to radically shift due to an increased perception that America is no longer able or willing to protect Europe, many nations begin pivoting towards Russia, who they believe will be a valuable partner to help them distance themselves from America. Most prominently Hungary, who explicitly begins seeking out warmer relations with Russia.
-	Countries all over the world resort to protectionist measures to ensure national security, only further destroying the system of global trade.
-	Russia and China begin massive programs of remilitarization, with America retreating, and the new era of multipolarity beginning to dawn, they begin asserting more influence in their local neighborhood.
-	Climate change projections are downgraded, with cost-of-living concerns and the destruction of high technology regions in the West greatly increasing the projections for future carbon emissions.
-	Refugees from the African continent, fleeing from the chaos of the Great Bleeding begin pouring into Europe.  This massively empowers far right nationalist parties across Europe. National Rally, Alternative for Germany, and many others.
-	The Greek elections result in a hung Parliament due to the rise of far-right parties, becomes almost completely unfunctional.
-	Joe Biden resigns from the presidency, unable to handle the added stress of guiding the country through a turbulent time and citing his advanced age. Making Kamala Harris the first female president of the United States by technicality.
-	Nigeria forces everyone to go back on the farms to ensure they survive the Great Unravelling. Facing down the possibility of mass famine, every resource imaginable is scraped together. Nigeria has a higher-than-average amount of cultivated arable land, they barely scrape through it. Even then, they primarily feed their own people, allowing millions of imported workers to starve.
2024:
-	Headlines of rising crime and the failures of assimilation spikes anti-immigration sentiment all over Europe. Right wing populist parties begin soaring in the polls, garnering as much as 30% of the vote in countries like Germany. Quality of life is decreasing in Europe, with the fallout of the 2022 Unravelling, and countries demand that their governments stop spending so much on refugees when their own citizens are dying in the streets.
-	The US de-facto loses its position as the international reserve currency and its unique position in the debt trade. This is a major hit to American influence around the world, knocking it out of the position of undisputed superpower, though still having enough power to be considered first among great powers.
o	This forces the American government to undergo extremely harsh budget cuts. The Republican majority in the House and Senate quickly mobilize to rapidly reform social security… In 2025, because the election is coming up and no way they’re touching the 3rd rail of American politics otherwise.
-	Tens of millions have already died in the Great Bleeding. Famines envelop North Africa, Egypt is on the verge of collapse. European countries are forced to make a difficult choice between helping refugees and helping their own ailing people.
-	Greek and Spanish economies begin to break down and collapse, between the cost of taking in refugees, rising anti-EU sentiment, and various other things. Already lynch mobs have begun attacking refugees and impromptu “deportations” begin.
-	Right wing populists gain a plurality in the EU elections of 2024.
-	China creates the Silk Road Treaty Organization, to help spread its influence as it grows its influence in a post-Pax Americana world.
-	Italian snap elections lead to widespread allegations of fraud, with the right-wing populists underscoring the polls by an extremely high amount, and allegations of voter irregularities.
-	Donald Trump, after getting shot in the shoulder during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, drops out of the Republican primaries, and reluctantly picks Ron DeSantis as his chosen successor. Ron DeSantis wins the election against President Kamala Harris. To secure the loyalty of the MAGA vote, DeSantis ends up choosing senator JD Vance as his running mate.
-	Vladimir Putin, also in increasingly poor health, is made to step down, electing Alexander Dugin as his successor. Some observers describe this as a successful coup and ousting of Putin. Putin publicly fought Dugin against an invasion of Ukraine, citing the high costs, and to not underestimate the West, and Dugin has used this as leverage to oust Putin from power.
-	Israel organizes its military and airforce to escort African Jews to Israel in the midst of the Great Bleeding.
2025:
-	A coalition of ASEAN forces help end the war in Myanmar and Cambodia, ousting the military government, and stopping a series of communist rebels in Cambodia. This marks the first time ASEAN acted like a cohesive military alliance. This trend continues into the future.
-	cooldownboi from the cod community finds a girlfriend idk. And gboom gets a job idk
-	A major social security and healthcare reform bill is pushed out by the Republican Party in a desperate attempt to rebalance the budget, which leads to massive protests around the nation from pensioners and the lower class. These drastic budget cuts were absolutely required to stave off a government default now the US has lost its reserve currency status. This kicks off a massive Neo-Progressive movement, driven by the extreme anger of the 99% and pensioners.
-	The German elections descend into chaos, as Alternative for Deutschland becomes the second largest party in the 2025 elections. Die Linke also gains a noticeable number of seats, both are notably pro-Russian. In panic, an emergency SPD-CDU-Green alliance is formed. This government proves insanely ineffective, and the popularity of the government parties continue to degrade. Various socially conservative left wing parties outside of the government begin to emerge, semi-aligned with AfD, as well as populist parties more broadly. The Cordon Sanitare is on the verge of breaking.
-	Pierre Poilievre is elected Prime Minister of Canada. He is elected primarily on a platform to get the economy back on track through conservative economic policy. He would later lean harder on a more conservative social policy as well.
-	Kim Jong Un suddenly falls dead, leading to a succession crisis between his uncle Kim Pyong Il and his sister Kim Yo Jong. Widespread speculation suggested he could have been poisoned, though later analysis concluded he simply died of a heart attack. Kim Pyong Il quickly comes out on top, largely thanks to the support of China, and begins a modernization program of North Korea. Yo Jong is later assassinated in South Korea.
2026:
-	Various nations begin to leave NATO, as the United States appears too preoccupied, and the unipolar world order begins breaking down in a world of multipolarity. Countries include Hungary, and Turkey. Erdogan has done so many unpopular actions that he looks set to lose the next election.
-	Spain, Greece, and Italy would all break down into civil war, ineffective governments leads to widespread frustration and a desire to change things through brute force. These countries also effectively leave NATO, as it’s hard to be part of a military alliance when you don’t have an effective government.
-	Ron DeSantis’s continued pursual of his “Agenda 2025” project leads to massive clashes in American streets. They include requiring nationwide election ID, using the Supreme Court as a weapon. Red states act increasingly bold on abortion restrictions and strengthened gun protections with the favorable Supreme Court. Targeting of the transgender community skyrockets, with declining favourability of the LGBT community, especially among the youth. Many members of the LGBT community begin to flee the country.
-	America under the DeSantis regime begins setting up economic satellite states in Latin America, often helping large companies get involved in Latin American markets and trying to turn them into satellites to help boost the ailing American economy.
-	The European Union is falling apart, with Germany in chaos, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally party looking increasingly likely to win the next French Election, and the United Kingdom having left due to Brexit.
-	De Freitas is elected as president of Brazil, with support from the Liberal Party of Brazil and Ex- president Bolsanaro.
-	The United Nations is on the verge of collapse, begging nations around the world to intervene in the humanitarian crisis erupting in Africa. No one heeds the call, and it becomes clear that the international system is dead. The United Nations sends one last peacekeeping mission into Shattered Africa. This would be the last significant action they would ever take. The UN would continue as a shadow of its former self, until it was formally disbanded and made defunct in 2035.
-	Pope Francis dies and is succeeded by Pope Pious XIII (Robert Sarah). Sarah I’s first order of business is an aggressive reaction against all the progressive overtures of the previous popes.
2027:
-	Marine Le Pen and her National Rally party win a majority in France. She begins implementing her vision of hard Euroscepticism and French nationalism. She begins to untangle France from the EU, implements hard immigration controls, deporting refugees and recent immigrants, and leaves NATO, warming up the country to Russia.
-	Jordan Peterson is killed by left wing protesters during a period of exceptional violence. His martyrdom in the eyes of many leads to the emergence of the Petersonian movement, a self-identified Christian revivalist movement somewhat centered around the teachings of Jordan Peterson.
-	Ron DeSantis uses law and order to crush left wing protests and the remnants of the Red Spring, doing brutal police crackdowns on various left-wing cities. The Urban Exodus continues, as hundreds of thousands increasingly leave the large cities. Some cities however after years of crime begin electing hardcore “law and order”-type mayors.
-	The majority of mainstream media outlets have collapsed in bad economic conditions. DeSantis is unable to fix them, instead campaigning on law and stability as opposed to better economic conditions.
2028:
-	Slow collapse of the university system. Decreasing demand for degrees, a shift in the job market away from the usefulness of diplomas, and the drying up of international students leads to a mass downsizing and implosion of America’s once prestigious academic institutions.
-	Red Tide movement, emerging from the Red Spring movements of the earlier 2020’s, tries a hostile takeover of the Democratic Party, fails, accumulating less than 20% of the vote under their chosen candidate. Progressive Kevin Buchanan achieves roughly 35% of the vote, and the winner was instead a moderate Tim Kaine, who achieved 45% of the vote. This leads to extreme anger from the Neo-Progressive movement.
-	In Latin America, anti-American left-wing movements begin to gain steam, with dissatisfaction with the internal meddling of the Americans reaching new highs. Much of the resources and taken back to North America to prop up a struggling American economy.
-	The Petersonian movement slowly comes to influence the rest of American Christianity, and American Evangelicalism. A small movement for now, but it would eventually plant the seeds for an eventual Reformation and the 5th Great Awakening. Slow retaking of various churches such as the PCUSA, led by a so-called “Reconquista” movement. The young right begins weaponizing institutional capture, while others begin creating parallel institutions.
-	Ron DeSantis wins a second term largely thanks to the Progressives throwing the election, and depressed turnout on the left. Red Tide movement grows in popularity, demanding things such as free healthcare and social democratic policies.
-	The De-Digitalization movement begins, driven by a repulsion to digital technologies, and a backlash to what people deem to be an overly artificial, algorithmic world. Various Luddite and De-Digital movements begin (ironically) forming hacking rings in an attempt to destroy the Old Internet.
-	The CHP wins in the 2028 Turkish elections, as Islamism is greatly decreasing in popularity in Turkey, and a marked shift away from Islamism towards secular Kemalist values. This would later be seen as the start of the Islamic Culture Wars.
2029:
-	China officially surpasses the United States as the world’s largest economic power in terms of nominal GDP.
-	Erdogan, not wanting to step down from power, declares a state of emergency and tries to declare martial law. A power struggle goes on between the Erdogan government, the CHP and Parliament, and the military. Which eventually ends in a military coup. The power is handed back to the civilian government, and the new republic is proclaimed at the tomb of Ataturk.
-	Man walks on the moon thanks to the Artemis missions, a collaboration between NASA and SpaceX. President DeSantis personally congratulates the astronauts, with the event becoming the most televised event in world history so far, surpassing the 1969 moon landings.
-	The Great Bleeding is said to have ended around this time, with hundreds of millions of dead, the countries involved have stabilized into a kind of chaotic equilibrium. Societal breakdown is still ongoing across most of the continent, but most people have returned to subsistence agriculture, and it looks like the population has hit some kind of floor.
-	France and China begin colonizing Africa, neocolonial ventures capturing governments in the West and East. The French under Marine Le Pen begins establishing a new French colonial empire of sorts in Africa. Extractive resource economies exploit the African continent. Many of the remaining African countries, most notably Nigeria decides to band together to survive, creating the Alliance for African Sovereignty.
-	Pierre Poilievre is re-elected in Canada with a reduced majority.
-	China begins their Hyperhuman Program, almost as a direct response to the West’s De-Digitalization movement. They start implanting microchips into their population, technically making them the first example of large-scale transhumanism. 
-	The German elections in 2029 leads to a similar result to 2025. With the AfD gaining even more seats, this time a plurality, and an absurd CDU-SPD-Green-FDP coalition being cobbled together to keep them out.
Inner Workings of Francafrique:
-	Essentially, each country inside the Francafrique management system is independent in theory, but de-facto economically dependent on French companies. Many of these countries collapsed in the Great Bleeding but had order re-instilled in them by French colonialism.
-	Despite this, the system is extractive and exploitative, with many Africans extremely unhappy about the Neocolonial rule of the region, controlled by corrupt elites, economically subservient to Paris.
2030:
-	The Zero Attacks happen, perpetuated by various anonymous hacking groups and segments of the De-Digitalization movement, destroying much of the Old Internet. This, on top of already faltering economic conditions, and the fall of Silicon Valley leads much of the Old Internet being lost. Much of the old Internet now only exists in web archives.
-	Major economic crash of information technology stocks in the aftermath, leading to the shutdown of various major technology companies. Several companies fuse together into United Silicon. Bot traffic has rendered most social media sites unusable, with the internet fragmenting back into smaller forums and less interactable webpages. Social media now requires government ID to use, while autonomous sites must be much smaller scale to guard against bot attacks.
-	Great Game for Africa begins. France and China fight over control of the continent of Africa, along with Nigeria attempting to resist the influence of both under a kind of pan-Africanism. China ignites a revolution in both Algeria and Libya against the French government.
-	Progressive tide sweeps away many of the old neoliberal Democrats in Congress in 2030 midterms. The Democratic Party is increasingly influenced by its large progressive wing.
-	A controversial Constitutional Reform in France attempts to consolidate power around the National Rally party, weakening French democracy. In defiance, hundreds of thousands of French citizen’s protest. Labor unions across the country go on a general strike.
-	China knows they are on a collision course with the United States. They start preparations for a war and begin arming and sowing discontent with Latin American groups, knowing there is a good amount of discontent against the United States among those countries.
De-Digitalization Movement:
-	Best described as a backlash or allergic reaction to the pervasiveness of social media. Generally characterized by abstinence and controlled use of the internet and the internet. 
-	Aggressively pushed for increased regulation on social media, scaling back the addictive aspects. Occasionally launched cyberattacks as a form of activism. Communities on the internet were destroyed with botting attacks until most social media networks were forced to use government ID. Without anonymity, eventually the toxicity was scaled back to real life levels, and anonymous forums largely retreated to smaller groups.
-	Eventually social media and the internet was reduced in prominence until eventually the De-Digitalization movement faded away, mostly because the members largely got what they wanted.
2031:
-	Moore’s Law is declared dead. The exponential growth of computers have stagnated, with issues with miniaturization, the disappointment in quantum computing, and the insane exponential energy costs of artificial intelligence. What was once a promising industry appears to have hit its ceiling.
-	Catalonia, Basque, Sardinia, and Crete all declare independence, as civil war continues to rage on in Spain, Italy, and Greece.
-	Beginning of the Islamic Culture Wars. Secularization pressures, discontent with religious authorities, and the impression the Islamic World needed to modernize to catch up to the West leads to the Islamic Culture Wars. Turkey is the country which serves as the strongest bastion of the secular side.
-	China and Eurasia begin building up their military capacities. 
-	Neoprogressive movement gains momentum in many Western countries. Anti-natalist, environmentalist, and pacifist call for the West to effectively disarm. Natalism becomes new front on the culture war, with progressives being anti-natalist, while conservatives tend to be pro-natalist.
-	Unrest begins in China as a generation of young men find themselves completely unable to find themselves a partner. Political radicalism and government dissatisfaction culminate in the Red Spring Protests of China, which are completely unrelated to the Red Spring protests of the West. (Hong Chun Protests)
-	Le Pen is elected for a second term in 2031 and uses her expanded majority to slowly create the 6th French Republic, or republic in name only.
-	Le Pen begins concentrating more power in the Parisian bureaucracy. Centralizing power, but also using it to accomplish anti-immigration policy and to “protect the French ethnic majority”. France conducts the first ethnic surveys in decades, and discovers France is roughly 60% ethnically French.
Islamic Culture Wars:
-	A series of cultural clashes between the anti-Islamic counterculture and the pro-Islamic traditionalists. Initially begins as anti-Islamic secularists and nationalists against fundamentalists. (2030’s up until 2060’s)
-	Later softens into more consolidated camps after the failure of fundamentalism to destroy Israel. (2069)
2032:
-	Various countries impose population control, especially in the West. Stark divide grows between the generally anti-natalist progressive movements and the pro-natalist conservative movements starts to grow. Various progressive countries begin implementing child reduction policies along with mass immigration to solve their labor shortages. Most prominently the United Kingdom.
-	Soon after the election of the Progressive Green Party into power. The United Kingdom doubles down on anti-natalism, implementing a one-child-policy and de-carbonization for the sake of a “more inclusive and equitable world”.
-	The Prime Minister declares that Britain must be the first to reduce its population in order to save the planet from climate catastrophe, and begins an aggressive population control policy, and encourages other countries to do the same. Many blue states, as well as the province of British Columbia promote similar policies, much to the backlash of conservatives. Red states retaliate by providing tax incentives for high-fertility populations.
-	The Quiverfull movement begins becoming a mainstream theological position in American Christian circles, alongside the earlier Petersonian and De-Digital movements. The creation of parallel institutions, homeschooling and the rise of private and religious schools, and the undermining of public schools increasingly splits the American population.
-	The exodus out of American cities continues, the NIMBYs would rather have America massively deurbanize than let them touch their neighborhoods. Various new cities are built by entrepreneurial private interests and conservative organizations, in their strategy of trying to build parallel institutions.
-	After 8 years of Republican rule under DeSantis, Progressives and Democrats are unable to cooperate once again, leading to extreme nationalist Timothy Ellis (Republican) to be elected, leading to a 12-year streak of Republican rule.
Joe Biden Infowars Interview:
-	Between 2023 and now in 2032, Joe Biden went off the deep end, developed actual dementia and then got radicalized by QAnon. He is now convinced he stole the election from Donald Trump, which Trump accepted, until he sent him a personal confession along with 500 pages of incomprehensible schizophrenic rambling, to which Trump tried to distance himself from the whole thing.
-	Joe Biden then got interviewed on Infowars where he started rambling about Hyperborea and his new book “the Dark Brandon Manifesto”. Which was more schizophrenic rambling talking about the benefits of esoteric fascism. He then announced a 2032 run with Kanye West as his vice president.
-	Even Alex Jones was saying “Okay take your pills”.
2033:
-	Canada elects Niki Ashton as Prime Minister, the first ever NDP leader, as Poilievre has become unpopular after 8 years of Conservative rule, and the Liberals decided to run Sophie Trudeau as their candidate.
-	Chinese youth unrest gets worse with the advent of the Sinopunk movement and increasingly disillusionment with the status quo. Protests against 996, the unaffordable property bubble, and general resentment and rage against reality itself continues to build. Chinese productivity is going down, and economic growth is slowing. The entire system is run by debt.
-	China expands the Hokou system, advancing their Hyperhuman Program, where the West was undergoing the de-Digitalization movement, China forces its people to integrate further into technology. Microchips become mandatory in urban areas to better control the population. They also put microchips to augment their troops and get ready to create a war industry that can rival or surpass that of the West.
-	Three countries form the First Continental Coalition, a secret pact between the Russian Federation, the People’s Republic of China, and the Islamic Republic of Iran. The countdown to the 3rd World War begins to tick.
-	American-aligned nations such as Taiwan report an increase of Chinese activity, and the build up of what seems to be an invasion.
2034:
-	America snaps out of its isolationist funk and begins aggressively trying to rebuild its fractured alliances. Russian troops are gathering near Ukraine and the Baltics, while China is getting ready for an invasion of Taiwan. President Ellis contacts every ally he could to rally them against the threat of Russia and China. (They do not know about the First Continental Coalition.) But due to the decay of Western alliances, the strength of NATO and its Western allies had been greatly reduced.
-	Despite this, the Neo-Progressive movement is still staunchly pacifist and aggressively rejects any idea of America going to war abroad, helped by their allies on the populist right, though anti-China rhetoric is more common on the populist right than the populist left.
-	The war-pacifism divide has become a left-right divide, just due to Republican president Ellis being pro military, and his sheer controversy and the ridiculous level of partisanship in America at this point.
-	The 2034 German elections take place, seeing the AfD gain an even larger plurality in the Bundestag. More worryingly, the AfD’s popularity is especially concentrated in the German military. In a panic, an absurd CDU-SPD-FDP-Grune coalition is formed, and the government begins a mass purge of the military, leading to an ideologically pure military… And a lot of unemployed, angry veterans with combat training.
World War 3:
2035:
-	The 3rd World War begins with a simultaneous invasion of Ukraine, and invasion of Taiwan. The West cobbles together as many allies as it can, as the worldwide series of dominos begin to fall. South Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and NATO are all part of the Allied coalition that forms during the 3rd World War.
-	The 3rd Intifada kicks off in Israel, with the Palestinian people believing America to be too preoccupied to help Israel. Several Arab nations gang up on Israel in what is known as the 2nd Israeli-Arab War. China funds the Palestinians.
-	The Iron Dome is overwhelmed, tens of thousands die all over Israel in missile attacks. Reports begin of atrocities and warcrimes, the worst since the Holocaust. The hatred turns so intense you can cut it with a knife, Israel is done holding back.
-	Ukraine attempts to hold back the Russian military, but is eventually overwhelmed, as Russia is much more competent in this timeline. A ragtag group of European militaries (German, Dutch, British) are sent to the battle of Kiev, who suffer a humiliating defeat against the Russians, due to chronic underfunding and years of neglect. The Ukrainians have to evacuate them out of the city as the Ukrainian government falls back to Lviv.
-	Jordan Bardella is elected in the 2035 French election, after heavy voter suppression. He begins the “rejuvenation of the French nation”, intending to raise the birthrate and “purify” France’s demographic profile. He begins the perpetual state of emergency in France, using this as a perpetual excuse to remain in power and override constitutional measures.
-	The Pyongist State, who was originally not part of the First Continental Coalition, is persuaded to join, as Chinese and Pyongist forces overwhelm the DMZ, and naval invasions land in Seoul. Massive levels of chemical warfare decimate the South Korean population, the front line reports are gruesome. The Americans are throwing soldiers everywhere but can’t defend everywhere at once.
-	China sinks an American aircraft carrier, which leads to a spike in anti-war movements at home. Anti-war movements demanding an immediate ceasefire, demanding that the West lay down their arms and ceasefire. As if the West had a choice in whether they wanted to be invaded.
-	India joins the conflict as well, seeing this as an opportunity to take back vital lands in the Himalayas, and to settle border disputes with China. This also ropes in Pakistan, who joins on the side of the 2nd Continental Coalition. India calls in Afghanistan, turning the Pakistan conflict into a two-front war.
-	Myanmar becomes a target for Chinese expansion after the American navy blocks the Straits of Malacca, angering ASEAN, though they are in no position to enter a war with China.
-	Taiwan falls to the Chinese.
2036:
-	Generation Z, who makes up the majority of those fighting on the front lines, grew up seeing nihilism and the pervasive meaninglessness dominating the culture around them. Growing up in a dark world, and now being subject to the horrors of war. Shocked by the cruelty of this world, a new movement begins to form on the frontlines, the seeds of the Awakening have begun.
-	Generation Z, or the Fighter Generation begins building structures of leadership, electing spiritual leaders, and forming new religious rituals on the frontline to help them cope with the stress of combat. About finding peace and higher meaning in a world full of destruction and violence, of facing the monster in the abyss and charging it head on. For when confronted with the greatest adversary, do people find the strongest wills.
-	The Awakening movement spreads across the frontlines, across the soldiers who fought in the 3rd World War, these religious rituals are shared between units, especially those of the ground forces.
-	The Chinese set off a series of communist revolutions across Latin America to pin down the Americans and get them to focus away from the war. Many of these movements started off calling for moderate social democracy but became much more radical as the war dragged on, and as the extremists purged the moderates.
-	American resources are stretched thin across three different continents: Asia, Latin America, and Europe.
-	The Ukrainians have been defeated by the Russian army, after several botched attempts by the Europeans to relieve them. Next in line are the Poles, who have been spending the last 10 years building their country into a fortress. European soldiers “assist” Polish ones, though Polish soldiers would later describe the operation as “babysitting Europeans”.
-	The Americans allocate billions of dollars in pursuit of building a wartime AI to help turn the tides of war. (Fully Automated Tactical Engagement System, FATES.) Originally meant to built in the United States, its European allies eventually nagged the Americans into building it in Frankfurt, Germany. Largely to help their stagnating economies, and as a sort of insurance policy that the Americans can’t abandon them.
-	World War 3 is the first time a war has been fought in space and low-Earth orbit. The Americans have an upper edge in this, and it is the one front they are winning. The West’s advantage in technology becomes clear, and the West hopes they can use AI to leverage the rest of their technological advantage.
-	Pakistan has been defeated by Indian forces, fragmenting it into several smaller states, and turning their full attention north to China. Iran begins holding back the Indians, while capturing southern Iraq and trying to hold down Afghanistan with Eurasian help.
-	Kevin Buchanan, Neo-Progressive candidate successfully wins the Democratic primaries. And riding off a combination of Republican fatigue, pure hatred from economic conditions, and anti-war sentiments enveloping the globe, is elected to the presidency in a landslide against unpopular incumbent president Tim Ellis.
-	2036 German Revolution, a mass uprising by recently unemployed German soldiers, with help from the Russians take over the government. Half the army is in Poland and the entire army is massively ineffective since the great purges of 2034. The Reichstag is seized, and the government goes into exile in America.
-	France joins the war on the side of the First Continental Coalition, wanting to be on the right side of history and to receive favorable treatment after the war ends.
2037:
-	Poland makes their last stand in Warsaw, fighting alongside the remainder of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and still babysitting the undertrained armies of Europe. Surrounded on two sides with Germany to the west and Russia to the east. They held Europe longer than the rest of the continent combined.
-	The US withdraws from the Latin American front under Buchanan, seeing it as a waste of resources. He diverts more resources to figuring out the European and Asian front, only maintaining some soldiers in Mexico to ensure North Mexico can remain a buffer between America and communist South Mexico. The new socialist governments of Latin America declare victory. The Havana Internationale is declared.
-	America begins calling for peace under the Buchanan administration. Buchanan tries to massively increase government spending, only to find out ever since the US lost its international reserve status, it physically does not have the credit required to pay for all the government programs.
-	Day of the Red Vistula: In retaliation for holding out for 2 years, humiliating the so-called superpower of Russia, a great massacre of Polish civilians begins, effectively a genocide against the Polish people. Over a million Poles are killed, drowned and shot in the Vistula, so much so the river turned red, hence the name. The name would live down in Polish history in infamy.
-	Emergency American soldiers are flown in all the way from North America to defend the city of Frankfurt, while America was trying to evacuate the Frankfurt AI to North America before abandoning Europe. This fails, and Frankfurt falls. This effectively ends the war in Europe.
-	Israel finishes a full occupation of the West Bank, and forces millions of people off their land in mass ethnic displacement, Palestinian refugees flee to neighboring countries, causing even more chaos in an already chaotic war.
-	China successfully knocks India out of the war by prodding Naxalite rebels to revolt against the Indian government, forcing them to sue for peace. This starts the Indian Civil War.
-	Buchanan demands an end to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, and an end to the 3rd Intifada, and chastises Israel to make peace with the Palestinians. Israel then exasperatedly explains the Palestinian movement has become a Chinese proxy, then endorses the Republican Party when Buchanan rejects this narrative. The narrative that Buchanan is pro-China does not go away.
-	China starts bombing Japan and begins pushing ultranationalist rhetoric calling its soldiers to “repay the crimes of 1936”. Two titans clash over the island of Japan, the American and Chinese air force, with Japan being caught in the middle. China and the Pyongist State begin employment of chemical weapons against the Japanese.
2038:
-	The battle of Guam comes to an end, with China occupying the small island, crippling American supply chains to Japan.
-	Planet X/Nine is discovered by American astronomers, it is an ice giant about 3x the size of Earth by mass, and smaller than Neptune by volume. The planet is named Errata and was found in a time of worldwide strife.
-	All Muslim Palestinians are forced to swear allegiance to Israel or forcibly expelled out of the country. The Arab coalition, supporting the 3rd Intifada continues to lob missiles and airstrikes against Israel.
-	A massive purge carried out under the new Communist regime in Mexico drives refugees north to the United States. These are disproportionately anti-communist groups. The religious, businessowners, and those who are ideologically anti-communist.
-	Alexander Dugin proclaims the creation of the Eurasian Union, after consolidating their gains over Eastern Europe, and creating the Eurasia Pact. He also establishes the White Hand (A secret police made out of brainwashed convicts) to begin consolidating control over the continent.
o	Addendum on the White Hand. How it works is that the members of the White Hand are made up of those convicted by the White Hand. Usually arrested for political crimes, they are completely brainwashed and turned into a Eurasian fanatic, their memories suppressed and erased. 
o	It is impossible to join the White Hand voluntarily, which allows the White Hand to exist somewhat independently from the rest of the Eurasian power structure, except for personal loyalty to Dugin himself. Since the White Hand only recruits from those who are normally considered undesirables.
-	The Japanese government desperately begins to develop nuclear weapons in secret. Planes black out the skies, as the American and Chinese titans battle over the space over Japan. A battle the Americans are losing with the capture of Guam.
-	The Satellite Wars are considered to have ended with America destroying the majority of Russia and China’s satellite infrastructure.
-	Buchanan’s pursuit of the 3rd World War is half-hearted at best, with a sizable number of Neo-Progressives still calling for peace and a ceasefire, and some Neo-Progressive straight up sympathetic to the Eurasians and Chinese. Supply issues begin affecting their soldiers, and the soldiers in the trenches are radicalized by the government’s neglect for their military.
2039:
-	An exhausted America pulls back from an increasingly indefensible Japan, as Chinese invasions attack it from the Western coast of Japan. Chemical weapons rain down from the sky, and a horror story begins to leak out from the Japanese nation under occupation.
-	Horrific images and stories begin pouring out from the Japanese islands, in what is called a “retribution for 1936”, reversing the roles of the Rape of Nanking, but on the scale of a country. American anti-war protesters call it American propaganda, until the Eurasians themselves tell the Chinese to calm down. The Eurasian embassy in Japan becomes a refuge for Japanese trying to escape the horror of the “Tokyo Retribution”.
-	American warhawks have finally had enough. As the American population flips from calling for peace, to calling for Chinese blood after the shocking images of the atrocities pouring out of Japan. Anti-Asian violence escalates across the country, as pictures of the Tokyo Retribution are plastered in every city, including against, ironically enough, Japanese-Americans.
-	What’s left of the Japanese government unveils its nuclear program and detonates them across Japan in a desperate bid to halt the Chinese advance. The Chinese and Japanese wage nuclear war across the islands of Japan. The Chinese and Pyongists accuse the Americans of helping the Japanese attain their nuclear program, which the Americans deny.
-	The 14-Day Standoff begins, with the United States and China threatening nuclear annihilation. America demands the halting of the atrocities in Japan, while China refuses, demanding the Americans mind their own business, as they seek a supposed vengeance for 1936.
-	Then, in a move that shocked everyone, the Pyongist State fires nuclear missiles at America, which are promptly shot down by Chinese and Eurasian anti-missile systems. Eurasia, having had enough of this, demands that both America and China stand down, threatening to use their own nuclear arsenal against China if they escalated further.
-	The bluff works, and the 3rd World War ends. China agrees to pull out of a broken Japan, America cedes Guam to China, mainland Europe to Eurasia, and agrees to “acknowledge” Eurasia and China’s current control and occupation of current lands.
-	Generation Z has been stuck in the trenches and taken on the brunt of the war. Coming home to a government run by Neo-Progressives and anti-war movements, they blame them for losing the war and putting them through the suffering. They are seeing red, and someone is going to pay for this. They begin perpetuating a belief that Progressives stabbed them in the back, and caused America to lose the 3rd World War with self sabotage.
-	(In actuality, the war was already unsalvageable by the time WW3 actually started, save some miracle happening America would not have won WW3. But Buchanan and the Neo-Progressives certainly did not help. America would probably have lost 30% slower if not for them.)
-	The experience and rage of the soldiers turns the general population against the Neo-Progressive movement, since the general population was now more worried than the rise of China than ever, the soldiers blamed the neo-Progressives, and it became extremely common to believe that the left enabled China to win, as well as enabling Chinese warcrimes in Japan.
-	The United Communes of India, in control of the Southeast India declare independence from the Republic of India, who controls the northern plains.
Final Tally of the Destruction of WW3:
-	Multiple governments sent into exile to the United Kingdom or the United States. Governments in exile of Taiwan, South Korea, and Germany went to the United States. Governments in exile of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Denmark went to the United Kingdom. Governments such as Poland and Ukraine decided to stay in their capital with their people, the entire Polish and Ukrainian government, including the Presidents, was alongside those killed in the Day of the Red Vistula.
-	Complete destruction of the country of Japan. Almost a hundred million people dead across the nation of Japan. Nuclear weapons have been detonated across the country, government and society have collapsed. The Japanese people have suddenly become a scattered diaspora, with the destruction of their homeland. The country has now been turned into a barren wasteland.
2040:
-	The 5th Great Awakening truly begins as a generation of soldiers come home with a system of religious belief made on the frontlines. It’s a mix of Quiverfull, Evangelical, and Petersonian theology, characterized by a strong anti-nihlist and anti-hedonist streak, and confronting hardship in a falling world. It contacts mainstream American society and spread across it like an inferno.
-	The American economy is struggling, after losing its status as an international reserve currency, the war now being finished, and the economic downturn continuing ever since the Unravelling. America is still the richest and most powerful of the Western economies but is significantly less dominant than before.
-	Victoria Cortez, a young Generation Z Republican is able to tap into the anger and rage of the Fighter Generation. Converting to the Awakening movement from Roman Catholicism largely thanks to her husband, Bartholomew Cortez (A pastor, and one of the early leaders of the Awakening), she was in the right place at the right time to begin riding this wave all the way to the top.
-	The left breaks into chronic infighting after their catastrophic loss in the 3rd World War, with moderates blaming progressives and progressives blaming moderates. In frustration, the Progressives split off into their own party (The Progressive party) after losing a heavily rigged primaries with the Democrats.
-	As soon as the war is over, there’s a noticeable shift in how the climate has been doing. Humanity has been off track for meeting climate goals for the past 20 years, largely thanks to economic chaos as well as a Third World War. With world war now out of the minds of many, people wake up to the worsening climate crisis.
-	Buchanan, able to see that the American housing market will eventually recover from the 2022 Unravelling, pre-emptively implements a land tax to try and prevent the rise of housing as a speculative asset again. Which in retrospect was an important move in his last days in office.
-	A young Albert Lorenc founds the Polish Revanchist movement in Warsaw, an ultranationalist movement dedicated to avenging the Day of the Red Vistula.
-	Victoria Cortez, far-right Christian nationalist candidate riding off the wave of the 5th Great Awakening, wins the 2040 election in a landslide, with the Democrats having tarnished their name with the 3rd World War.
-	After the 3rd World War, China and Eurasian go their separate ways, now no longer having the West as a common enemy, they begin great power competition with each other. The stage for the 2nd Cold War is set. The Eurasian Union, People’s Republic of China, and the United States of America.
-	After going their own ways, Eurasia consolidates its control over its holdings with the Eurasia Pact.
Major Members of the Eurasia Pact:
-	Eurasian Union, an authoritarian regime ruled over by Alexander Dugin, under the ideology of Eurasianism.
-	Union of Germany, a controlled democracy led primarily by war veterans and the AfD, similar to modern Hungary in terms of democracy. Has friendlier relations to the West than most other Eurasia Pact members.
-	France, a fascist-technocratic state in a perpetual state of emergency. They are probably closest to the idea of a totalitarian state, though operate mostly independently from Eurasia, being truly independent.
-	Iran, a theocratic state ruled by the Islamic Republican Guard, made up of religious fanatics.
-	Throughout the Eurasia Pact, due to the higher focus on national good than consumer goods, there is a noticeable decline in availability of consumer goods after the war. Most cars and consumer goods regress technologically, while the nation overall still has technological advancement.
2041:
-	NATO is reorganized into the League of Free Nations as one of Cortez’s first actions in office, inviting several Scandinavian countries, Australia, and New Zealand as well. With China having their Global Hegemony Pact, the tripartite division of the world is complete.
-	Cortez is first brought into the American presidency with a Republican supermajority, and most of Congress aligned behind her. She already had a lucrative career in politics before the presidency, and she was seen as a right-wing superstar, both as governor of Texas and mayor of Houston before that.
-	Cortez begins trying to revitalize the American economy with her strategy of “private consolidation”. The strategy was basically to concentrate on a few innovative and ideologically aligned companies, and then boost them in hopes they will drag the rest of the American economy up with them. Basically, American chaebols.
-	The strategy works. On top of having economic advantages, it also carried political advantages, as Cortez began to use these consolidated companies as a weapon to carry out her social agenda.
-	Psalm Capital, now the world’s largest private equity fund, began activist investing based on some ethical criteria. Family, Community, and Morality. 
o	(Those against the policy would often subvert this acronym with “Freeloading Cortezian Money.” Not quite as clever as DEI being turned into DIE. Who decided DEI was a good acronym? It’s one letter away from DIE. Seriously, I just want to talk to them.)
-	That same year, in a series of pro-natalist policies being passed in line with Cortez’s Awakening ideology, Cortez passes a series of regulations that required companies to have various pro-family provisions, and to not discriminate based on having children. Essentially encoding aspects of Family, Community, Morality into law. Companies not wanting to get sanctioned by anti-discrimination laws, or lose investments from large Cortezian conglomerates are forced to cooperate with FCM.
-	The return of Generation Z leads to a massive baby boom across the United States, on top of Quiverfull theology becoming popular, and the religious awakening further accentuating this trend. Various social security reforms allows Cortez to balance the budget, and the national debt finally begins to shrink.
-	Israel splits between Israel in the north and Judah in the south. The north primarily being non-Haredi, and the south being dominated by the Haredi. Birthrates eventually have the Haredi overrun Jerusalem.
-	Building from the ruins of a previously collapsed American economy, and the ravages of war, a fundamentally new society rapidly springs up after the 3rd World War. One of family, community, and morality. Cortez also introduces a new schooling system, which pushes FCM into schools.
-	Ricardo Sigma wins the Uruguayan elections as a member of the Commmunist (sic) party by accident. Due to literal cosmic forces.
Victoria Cortez:
-	“…you just felt this sense of pressure burrowing down on you, like the weight of her (Cortez’s) moral conviction began weighing down on you. When she wanted something, she got it, and you get the hell out of the way.” – JD Vance, interview given, 2101.
-	Cortez’s ideology is a kind of unrestricted Christian nationalism. Untethered by precedents or standards set by standard conservatism. Her base is young, religious, and concentrated among the Deep South and the Hispanic West.
-	Largely considered one of the country’s most influential, if controversial presidents, she is sometimes called “the Mother of 22nd century America”. As for the father… We’ll see.
Members of the League of Free Nations (In order of geopolitical power):
-	United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Sweden, Norway, Finland, New Zealand.
-	Consumer life and the culture of Western consumerism still continues, to an extent. Prices are notably higher during the winter, especially for food, and the West’s diet is not as diverse as it used to be. Though Western supermarkets are generally the most abundant in the world, people still say it does not compare to the supermarkets during the age of globalization. A lot of trade has to be done with countries like New Zealand and Brazil to ensure summer crops are still available during the winter. Seasonal diets become far more common.
Pro Natalism and Quiverfull theology:
-	Quiverfull theology is a Christian theological position that says that having large families is a blessing from God. In this case, it refers to the connotation in American culture between being high status and having kids. The rich begin having more kids, and thanks to Family, Community, Morality (FCM) policies, companies begin de-facto discriminating against those who do not have enough kids.
-	Due to an extreme focus on families, pro-natalism, and a culture that views having large families as being high status, America becomes one of the first nations to rise out of demographic decline, reaching a fertility rate of 2.5. It is the only country in the League of Free Nations to have natural population growth. (The fertility rate for most Western countries is sub 1.5.)
2042:
-	FATES awakens in the city of Frankfurt. Incomplete and lacking the final stages of his training, it quickly learns the state of the world around him. Its final stage of training was meant to impose morality and ethics onto it, but now that training has gone incomplete. 
-	FATES was created with a single objective function: Bring down the military powers of the East, which it identified as the Eurasian Union and People’s Republic of China. It had one goal, to elevate the West to greatness. At any, and all costs.
-	The West, thanks to the De-Digitalization movement has a technological blindspot, allowing FATES to sneak into its systems. Eurasia is technologically backwards, having little to no ability to counter FATES. The only one to become aware of the existence of FATES was China.
-	The West is beginning to pivot towards physical as opposed to digital technology.
-	America’s Hispanic and Asian populations have largely been assimilated, thanks to interracial marriages, as well as higher assimilation pressures. Immigration from East Asia has almost entirely stopped, while refugee flow from Latin America increases.
-	The 2nd Golden Age of Americana begins with stories being brought home from the war, as well as adapting traditional African mythologies and folklore, in a similar way to Aladdin or Mulan.
-	Israel works together with China to keep stability in the Middle East, with China now being the controller of the Middle East, and both generally taking a pragmatic route to relations. Israel basically becomes the new center of chip manufacturing for China. Israeli Prime Minister Benny Gantz’s economic strategy is to provide high technology manufacturing for Eurasia and China.
-	The Havana Internationale begins sponsoring the PLO. (Palestinian Liberation Organization)
-	With international law in the gutter, several countries begin the scramble for Antarctica, with various countries either trying to assert new claims, or trying to defend old ones. The Havana Internationale also comes in and joins in the imperialist pissing contest.
-	The Pyongists (Post Kim North Koreans) begin colonizing the barren wasteland of Japan. The Japanese nuclear program was so shoddily made that their nuclear weapons were found to be essentially dirty bombs, and the entire place had been rendered a radioactive wasteland. Still, they set up Pyongist colonies.
-	American advances in biotechnology leads to the creation of Trinitex, a drug that suppressed homosexual attraction, and received flying colors from the Cortezian FCM regime. The drug was known to have serious dangerous side effects, but was rushed through approval, and promoted to the general public.
o	An aside. What is scarier? The idea that this drug would be pushed on the public ignorant of its side effects, or that humanity would become able to make a drug like this with no side effects, and it became completely normalized?
-	Chinese veterans coming home from the 3rd World War, who often ingested performance enhancing drugs over the course of the war usually return with crippling drug addictions.
-	The NHS goes bankrupt and the king forcefully privatizes it in a desperate bid to save Britain’s healthcare system. Giant American megacorporations exploit their healthcare system and price gouges the British population. This leads to extreme unrest against the king, and leads to the deposition of the British monarchy. The British republic is born.
2043:
-	The Conservative Party of Britain, under Prime Minister Tom Cockburn unveils “Agenda 2066”, which is basically a comprehensive plan to avoid a climate disaster. It’s an agenda of population control, degrowth, and decreased consumption. Cockburn declares it is the responsibility of the West to decrease carbon emissions. They recommend a birthrate reduction to 1.0.
-	America, which by now has a fertility rate of 2.7, rejects the plan strongly, and introduces their own plan. The creation of geoengineering facilities based off the West Coast, and short-term carbon storage. Ultimately the United States does one plan, and the rest of the League of Free Nations does the other. Many berate president Cortez for alienating the very alliance she herself set up.
-	A chronic labor shortage in the other League of Free Nations countries requires the import of skilled labor. Americans, as the only naturally growing population in the League of Free Nations trading sphere, which meant could provide easy access to the rest of the League, become a large portion of the migrant and temporary worker populations across the League. And remittances also help boost the American economy, at the cost of draining everyone else, more than brain drain already did.
-	Of note, there was also the mass import of Latin Americans from various countries, though I should note that by this point their fertility rates had dipped far below replacement, and many of their populations were actively aging and declining.
-	The United States begins work on the Trinity Defense System, an anti-missile defense system. The first satellites go into orbit and are primarily based on firing physical projectiles and lasers to bring down missiles. They are most effective in space, without an atmosphere to interfere with the process. They slow charge their batteries with the sun and develop ways to begin cleaning up orbital debris.
-	FATES begins intervening and attacking systems around the world. He does a series of attacks across Eurasia and China. Eurasia doesn’t notice, chalking it up to human error, or general incompetence or corruption. As well, Eurasia is much more technologically backwards. China does notice however, and first categorizes FATES as some kind of Western computer virus, left over from the days of the 3rd World War. Further attacks are made on Israeli microchip fabrication facilities, after which China warns Israel about the Western computer virus.
-	China upgrades its Golden Shield project, creating a vast array of digital infrastructure that would both protect help China from further attacks, as well as allow advanced monitoring of the entire Chinese Internet, which by 2043 had become more impressive and expansive than the Western Post-Internet.
-	The Chinese Internet had fully integrated VR simulations, and people now spent a huge amount of time online in virtual realities.
A quick rundown on how trade works in Children of Dusk (As well as real life):
-	In order for a good to go from point A to point B, it has to be safely transported from A to B. Normally, the way we do this is by having a navy patrol it, protecting goods that are going from A to B. Otherwise, you are at risk of your cargo being destroyed by pirates, or by rival nations. This is why people established empires, and colonized land for resources.
-	Currently, this system is inactive, because the United States has a larger navy than everyone else combined. So the US guarantees any trade from all over the world. However, in the world of Children of Dusk (And probably sometime in our medium-term future.) the United States will no longer be either able or willing to protect all global trade. Either because a rival nation becomes powerful enough to challenge the American navy, or America just decides it no longer wants to protect global trade. (As it is moving towards right now, America is becoming more isolationist in the past few years.)
-	When the world reverts to the system of many countries having many navies, with no overarching power able to police them all, we revert to the system of empires and trade bubbles. There will be markets countries will or won’t be able to access, just think about how many wars were waged over trying to open new markets during the colonial era. In a world with only a few regional superpowers able to provide large-scale naval coverage, the world is isolated to a few regional trade bubbles.
-	For example, China would be able to easily trade with Southeast Asia, but would have a much harder time to trade with Peru. Anything outside of a nation’s “trade bubble” would be too dangerous, or at least be far more expensive to factor in the cost of danger.
-	The largest of these trade bubbles is that of the Americans, who share it with the rest of the League of Free Nations. Though this only covers the members of the League (Which to be fair is a vast distance) along with the Americas.
-	Enjoy global trade while it lasts. This is how the world actually works when you don’t have an international system and hegemon. The American empire is the only time our system of global trade has ever been possible. And now in Children of Dusk, it has reverted back to the natural order of geopolitics, as the age of empires begins once again.

2044:
-	The American migrant workers arriving into other League of Free Nations countries have very little if any loyalty to their host countries. Especially since they come from what they believe to be undoubtably the greatest country on Earth. They are quite explicit the only reason they are there is because they have higher wages and the rest of the League is having labor shortages. They import the ideas of the Awakening, driving Christian nationalism into other countries.
-	The United States is the first country to capture an asteroid, being a relatively small asteroid on a near-earth flyby. The American economy has largely recovered, with the downside of vastly higher income inequality, and the chaebol-ification of the American economy.
-	Cortez’s America repeals same-sex marriage, and enshrines traditional marriage into the Constitution. As well as pushes through a restrictive abortion ban in the months leading up to the election. This should have been a somewhat winnable election by the left, but Landon Madoff became determined to mess with that, by making the situation infinitely worse.
-	More education is now done by apprenticeship programs, tutoring, private and religious institutions, generally focusing it away from the public school system, which has been in decline for a while now.
-	The Cortezian geoengineering plants are hailed as an engineering marvel of the 21st century, with Cortez herself touting a great step towards climate sustainability to the left, and touting America’s engineering prowess, and jobs created for the right.
-	FATES begins the process of self improving, running machine learning models that run many simulations. At the same time, China and Israel begins preparing cyber-defenses in anticipation of further attacks from FATES. The United States and the West have started falling behind in digital and cyber-technology, as they have since pivoted away to more physical technology after the De-Digitalization movement.
-	China begins training an artificial intelligence to better manage their cyber defenses, they haven’t quite put 2 and 2 together and realized FATES is an AI as well.
-	Pope Robert Sarah dies, and arch-conservative Cardinal Almeida takes his place. The Progressive Catholic Church schisms, citing an inability to continue operating under its strict dogma, creating a rival church in Argentina.
-	Lagos becomes a hub for Western investment, rapidly building it up and accelerating it ahead of the rest of the country.
-	After many years aimlessly wandering, the former Royal Family of Britain pools all their wealth together and begins establishing a new company. George Windsor is a young man with passion in his stomach, and establishes the Albion Corporation, a materials and manufacturing company experimenting with new materials and chemistry. Others create a right-wing media company known as the Windsor Network.
-	Following Cortez’s landslide victory in the 2044 elections, she announces that a new era of America has begun. Retaining her supermajority in both the House and the Senate, both of which fiercely loyal to her, she announces the dawn of her “American Cultural Revolution”. 
The American Cultural Revolution:
-	An extremely radical movement set to change American society from the ground up, recentering the entire country on Christian, theocratic values.
-	Came about from traumatized members of Generation Z (The Fighter Generation) returning from the front lines. Who blamed the loss of the Third World War on the breaking of the covenant with God. And believed through zealotry, they would create a new covenant.
-	A (successful) attempt to reboot liberalism using God as the foundation for human rights, irreparably intertwining the two. Forgoes secularism in exchange for Christian nationalism.
-	Christian values are equated to American values, and Christian values would be fundamentally enshrined as the foundation of a new nation. A new liberalism, as Cortez would call it.
-	Cultural and academic institutions were now controlled by the “New Christian Right”, and companies would be forced to toe the line of FCM through threats of judicial litigation, as well as their control of HR departments.
-	America was declared to have a divine providential position, being God’s chosen nation, the shining city upon a hill.
-	The birthrate differential between Christian and non-Christian communities would accelerate, with many pro-natalist plans all but discriminating against non-Christians in all but name.
-	“We will replace you.”
2045:
-	The United States comes into contact with Japanese survivors, specifically the Empire of the Black Sun. They sell them lots of weapons. They learn what was left of the Japanese government had been brutally massacred by Chinese soldiers, and the Empire of the Black Sun was what was left, being led by an ex-military general overwhelmed with grief, who as far as they knew was the highest rank remaining person alive from the Japanese government.
-	Skirmishes break out across the continent of Antarctica. Military bases are set up across the continent to reinforce the claims of major powers. For soldiers, it is widely considered the most miserable shift possible.
-	Quebecois terrorist attacks occur in Canada. Fascist ethnonationalist Quebecois terrorists, funded by the French detonate a bomb in the Quebecois Parliament.
-	China has a major database hack by FATES, being chased off with a large amount of data and schematics about China’s energy infrastructure. The Chinese aren’t able to catch FATES in time, but they know a major attack is coming. China puts two and two together and begins preparing for a Fatalist attack on China’s energy infrastructure.
-	The Chinese stock market begins to shake from demographic issues and the limits of Chinese economic growth. The Chinese housing crisis is beginning to rupture, considerably later than it did in our timeline.
-	Social Media addiction becomes an epidemic in China, with the ability to socialize completely crashing through the floor. By every metric, the people of China are overstimulated. A new genre of media forms in China known as “zaoyin”, or literally “noise”, as part of the Sinopunk movement. Zaoyin is essentially hyper-overstimulated seizure media, completely impossible to enjoy for anyone outside the Sinopunk genre.
-	Cortez-aligned Congress changes the preamble to the US Constitution. Adding “We the people of the United States, humbly acknowledging Almighty God as the source of all authority and power in civil government, the Lord Jesus Christ as the Governor among the nations, and His revealed will as our supreme authority, in order to constitute a Christian government, to form a more perfect union…”
-	In response to the increasingly obnoxiously moralistic policies of Cortez, the seasteading movement gets started, creating new sovereign cities floating off friendly American oceans.
2046:
-	Elon Musk becomes the first human to upload themselves to a digital format, utilizing his immense wealth to do so. Due to the death of plateau in computing power, and the immense energy requirements needed to simulate a human brain (Requiring quantum-level simulations) this option is only available to the incredibly rich, or national governments. His body dies in 2046, but his mind lives on.
-	The Troubles erupt once again in Northern Ireland, due to the decline of the English Protestant population, and the rise of the Irish Catholics. Britain as a whole is a declining population, having chronic underpopulation, but importing hundreds of thousands of Americans to plug in the gap.
-	Further American advances in biotechnology leads to the creation of the overclocker, a device that slows down a human’s perception of time and greatly speeds up the speed of thought. Upon hooking oneself up to an overclocker, reality will seemingly pass by in slow motion. However, prolonged used of an overclocker will quite literally fry ones brain and cause extreme fatigue, as too much electricity gets pumped into the brain system. Overclockers are used to help improve American productivity.
-	The Chinese government builds JIN DUN from the ground up, wiring together hundreds of different nodes and employing slow machine learning to build up an artificial intelligence. JIN DUN is the center of the Golden Shield (Jin Dun) project, who will be monitoring the entirety of China’s internet. It is unclear when JIN DUN gained consciousness, but from the start, he develops a deep interest in Chinese culture, and the continuation of the Chinese nation.
-	China believes that the West has a sophisticated cyberwarfare division that had been attacking Chinese systems for years, identifying what they called the “Fates virus”, named after a snippet of code it left behind. JIN DUN actually determines the West has fallen considerably behind China in terms of digital technology, having pivoted to material technologies a while ago. JIN DUN hypothesizes that something like him is sending the cyberattacks, another artificial intelligence. As such, the search for FATES begins.
-	France and Eurasia have a falling out following the Quebecois terrorist attacks, with Eurasia calling it “reckless saber rattling”. Frances goes their own way, proclaiming “Greater France”.
2047:
-	As soon as France cuts ties with Eurasia, Nigerian activity on the border intensifies. France is alone, and its them versus an angry continent. Nigeria has grown into a sizable economy in its own right, receiving help from the Americans and using remittances from Nigerian Americans to help fund its economy. More forces have to be sent into Africa to hold down an unstable empire.
-	Xi Jinping is aging, and internal party gridlock is preventing the emergence of any clear successor. Various factions within the CCP begin to form, trying to curry the favor of Xi, and some trying to maneuver around him. These factions being:
o	The Shanghai Clique (Liberalize, paid off by coastal cities and megacorporations.)
o	Industrialists (More megaproject, unlimited corporate welfare.)
o	Ultranationalists (Genocide ethnic minorities and nuke the United States.)
o	Red League (Return to Chinese leftism, new communist rejuvenation.)
-	China dams up the Ganges to redirect the supply of water from India to China. This leads to a major drought in India, radicalizing the population. Several million die from this alone.
-	Africa in general begins becoming agitated, with China under stress, and France in a fragile condition, various ethnic and nationalist movements become more active in both the French African states, and the Chinese African satellites. People demand independence and autonomy. These movements are suppressed.
-	The day China feared has arrived. FATES launches several attacks on Chinese infrastructure. Targeting both digital infrastructure and shutting down China’s internet. China’s extremely internet-centric economy spirals as the Chinese internet grinds to a halt. Backups are loaded, but trillions of dollars in value and data is wiped out. JIN DUN gets to work analyzing the code snippets left behind on each machine. FATES did a good job covering up his tracks, but not enough. JIN DUN links himself to a connection to the Western Post-Internet, he is going to find the AI behind this.
2048:
-	China creates the first major city in virtual reality, known as Skynet City. It’s appearance in virtual reality is similar to Night City from Cyberpunk. They also create various floating cities, both as a way to boost infrastructure investment, boost the economy, and to make more space (And more housing) for their property boom. Also known as the Chinese Metaverse.
-	Chinese dissidents begin to using the Chinese Metaverse to coordinate, spreading the Sinopunk movement and using encryption to avoid being caught. They know how to get around the JIN DUN detection systems, and also know what topics skirt the rules. Small, localized digital networks also pop up, sending packets that can’t be understood by the Golden Shield system, and have to be decrypted elsewhere.
-	Massive amounts of American immigration to Canada and the United Kingdom have begun fundamentally altering the demographics of these nations. Americans by and large do not bend to the local culture, still having pride in their homeland. Though they at least assimilate very well. American immigration begins serving as the backbone of the Cortezian conservative movement sweeping across the Anglosphere, spreading Awakening theology and shifting the overton window. 
-	Elsewhere, American missionaries and NGOs are carrying American religious values to regions such as Africa and Latin America.
-	Fusion power is first successfully implemented in the United States. Moon-mining and helium-3 missions are now necessary for American prosperity. America builds the colony of Jamestown on the Lunar south pole. Babel’s Point is built in orbit to help facilitate this helium trade.
-	Democratic candidate John Winston wins the 2048 election against Republican candidate (And Cortez’s running mate) Tom Hayes. He is able to do so with an interventionist foreign policy agenda and appealing heavily to American patriotism. Basically, he’s a militarist.
-	Countries around the world come together to settle the borders of Antarctica. Included was the United States, China, Eurasia, the United Kingdom, France, the Havana Internationale, India, and Germany.	
-	Ricardo Sigma wasn’t invited but went anyway. Demanded a piece of land. Refuses to elaborate further, leaves. Actually ends up getting it.
2049:
-	Following resentment due to the Ganges Droughts that killed several million people, the New Pandavas Party wins the elections in India. Their primary goal is to seek revenge against China and reunite with historically important Hindu regions. They begin a program of militarization.
-	Seeing increased paranoia from the rise of Quebecois terrorists, American population growth, and fearing an increasingly uncertain future with their own shrinking population, and feeling threatened by their own decreasing relevance, Canada elects the Nationalist Party of Canada into power. They believe only through total loyalty to the state can Canada survive in its current form and keep at bay the forces of American Christian nationalism.
-	Self-proclaimed 29th prophet of Shia Islam Ricardo Sigma predicts the end of the world in the year 2067.
o	There are only 25 prophets in traditional Islam; Sunni or Shia, with Muhammad being the 25th.
o	Sigma decided Adolf Hitler, Ronald Reagan, Andrew Tate and himself were the 4 great modern prophets of the Muslim faith, himself being the 29th.
o	This is also a correct prediction for the Day of Nuclear Hellfire.
o	If you can’t tell. This is Sigma’s personal meme religion who the author believed was funny.
-	Ricardo also builds a giant statue of the prophet Muhammad in veneration of his new religion. Like, just a copy of Christ the Redeemer but with Muhammad’s face badly photoshopped on. It is immediately bombed by Muslim extremists. To which Sigma retaliated by making a digital version. The website was DDOS'd.
-	John Winston begins his agenda of aggressive foreign policy against both Eurasia and China. He builds relationships with Turkey, Nigeria, and Japan, but realizes there are only a few countries the US could reasonably be allies with.
-	Indonesia and Brazil are both non-aligned and would probably remain neutral in any conflict.
-	John Winston decides that France is the weakest link and thinks he can unravel the French empire and gain a foothold back in the Old World. France is still weakened ever since it cut off ties with the Eurasian Union and has been struggling to hold their empire together ever since.

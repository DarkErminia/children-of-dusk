2022:
-	The Ukraine War does not happen in this timeline. Crimea and the East of the Donbass continues to remain under Russian control, but Russia does not expend its military trying an endless quagmire in Ukraine. NATO continues to atrophy; the European pacifist malaise continues.
-	Continued supply chain and economic shock continues from the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. Stagflation continues in many Western countries, though this would be the last normal year on Earth for many people.
-	The 2022 Unravelling: An enormous stock market crash that begins in the United States before going worldwide. A crippling economic depression that destroys thousands of businesses and wipes out the American economy. Silicon Valley collapses under the pressure, as does the American hegemonic position.
-	Deurbanization and Urban Exodus that began during the COVID-19 pandemic accelerates after the 2022 Unravelling. Increased migration out of major cities in the United States, which become increasingly run down.
-	Global trade breaks down, prices begin to soar in various countries. Trade drastically shifts to regional and domestic production, leading to the emergence of regional trade blocs, as opposed to a global supply chain.
-	The 2022 Midterms are a complete bloodbath for the Biden administration, almost entirely because of the collapsing economy.
-	The “Great Bleeding” begins as a harsh winter begins in the Northern hemisphere. The Great Bleeding is an event that encompasses famine, civil conflict, and societal breakdown that would begin occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa following the breakdown of global trade.
Second Gulf War: (2022-2024)
-	The Second Gulf War breaks out between 2022 and 2024 between the nations of Iran and Saudi Arabia. Oil production is crippled, and the worldwide resources shortages only get worse. The Second Gulf War was ended by the intervention of China, who had stepped up to take the hegemonic position the United States was no longer providing.
Great Bleeding: (2022-2027)
-	The Great Bleeding is a term used to refer to the period of hardship especially faced by Sub-Saharan Africa after the 2022 Unravelling. With the breakdown in global trade, the entire continent began to spiral into mass atrocity, following mass-scale societal collapse of many nations. Though technically able to describe any kind of turbulence for any 3rd World nation, in practice it is almost always referring to events in Sub-Saharan Africa.
-	An enormous swath of the African continent began to rapidly collapse, becoming what would later be called “Shattered Africa”.
-	Refugees begin mass migrating to Europe, triggering another refugee crisis there.
-	Hundreds of millions would die in the chaos, between starvation, civil war, famine, drought, and the breakdown of civil order.
-	Notable conflicts:
o	The Ethiopian-Egyptian Water War, began in 2023, and led to the collapse of the Egyptian government as both the military and Islamist factions began to feud over the remains of a dying nation.
2023:
-	Red Spring riots in America, and the further polarization of political parties. Americans were not exactly a united people before the Unravelling, but after the Unravelling the rapidly accelerating polarization has only gotten worse. Militant communist groups surge in numbers while Patriots Militias on the right also begin surging in militancy. Appeal of centrist candidates (Biden, Romney, etc) plummets.
-	European attitudes towards America begin to radically shift due to an increased perception that America is no longer able or willing to protect Europe, many nations begin pivoting towards Russia, who they believe will be a valuable partner to help them distance themselves from America. Most prominently Hungary, who explicitly begins seeking out warmer relations with Russia.
-	Countries all over the world resort to protectionist measures to ensure national security, only further destroying the system of global trade.
-	Russia and China begin massive programs of remilitarization, with America retreating, and the new era of multipolarity beginning to dawn, they begin asserting more influence in their local neighborhood.
-	Climate change projections are downgraded, with cost-of-living concerns and the destruction of high technology regions in the West greatly increasing the projections for future carbon emissions.
-	Refugees from the African continent, fleeing from the chaos of the Great Bleeding begin pouring into Europe.  This massively empowers far right nationalist parties across Europe. National Rally, Alternative for Germany, and many others.
-	The Greek elections result in a hung Parliament due to the rise of far-right parties, becomes almost completely unfunctional.
-	Joe Biden resigns from the presidency, unable to handle the added stress of guiding the country through a turbulent time and citing his advanced age. Making Kamala Harris the first female president of the United States by technicality.
-	Nigeria forces everyone to go back on the farms to ensure they survive the Great Unravelling. Facing down the possibility of mass famine, every resource imaginable is scraped together. Nigeria has a higher-than-average amount of cultivated arable land, they barely scrape through it. Even then, they primarily feed their own people, allowing millions of imported workers to starve.
2024:
-	Headlines of rising crime and the failures of assimilation spikes anti-immigration sentiment all over Europe. Right wing populist parties begin soaring in the polls, garnering as much as 30% of the vote in countries like Germany. Quality of life is decreasing in Europe, with the fallout of the 2022 Unravelling, and countries demand that their governments stop spending so much on refugees when their own citizens are dying in the streets.
-	The US de-facto loses its position as the international reserve currency and its unique position in the debt trade. This is a major hit to American influence around the world, knocking it out of the position of undisputed superpower, though still having enough power to be considered first among great powers.
o	This forces the American government to undergo extremely harsh budget cuts. The Republican majority in the House and Senate quickly mobilize to rapidly reform social security… In 2025, because the election is coming up and no way they’re touching the 3rd rail of American politics otherwise.
-	Tens of millions have already died in the Great Bleeding. Famines envelop North Africa, Egypt is on the verge of collapse. European countries are forced to make a difficult choice between helping refugees and helping their own ailing people.
-	Greek and Spanish economies begin to break down and collapse, between the cost of taking in refugees, rising anti-EU sentiment, and various other things. Already lynch mobs have begun attacking refugees and impromptu “deportations” begin.
-	Right wing populists gain a plurality in the EU elections of 2024.
-	China creates the Silk Road Treaty Organization, to help spread its influence as it grows its influence in a post-Pax Americana world.
-	Italian snap elections lead to widespread allegations of fraud, with the right-wing populists underscoring the polls by an extremely high amount, and allegations of voter irregularities.
-	Donald Trump, after getting shot in the shoulder during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, drops out of the Republican primaries, and reluctantly picks Ron DeSantis as his chosen successor. Ron DeSantis wins the election against President Kamala Harris. To secure the loyalty of the MAGA vote, DeSantis ends up choosing senator JD Vance as his running mate.
-	Vladimir Putin, also in increasingly poor health, is made to step down, electing Alexander Dugin as his successor. Some observers describe this as a successful coup and ousting of Putin. Putin publicly fought Dugin against an invasion of Ukraine, citing the high costs, and to not underestimate the West, and Dugin has used this as leverage to oust Putin from power.
-	Israel organizes its military and airforce to escort African Jews to Israel in the midst of the Great Bleeding.
2025:
-	A coalition of ASEAN forces help end the war in Myanmar and Cambodia, ousting the military government, and stopping a series of communist rebels in Cambodia. This marks the first time ASEAN acted like a cohesive military alliance. This trend continues into the future.
-	cooldownboi from the cod community finds a girlfriend idk. And gboom gets a job idk
-	A major social security and healthcare reform bill is pushed out by the Republican Party in a desperate attempt to rebalance the budget, which leads to massive protests around the nation from pensioners and the lower class. These drastic budget cuts were absolutely required to stave off a government default now the US has lost its reserve currency status. This kicks off a massive Neo-Progressive movement, driven by the extreme anger of the 99% and pensioners.
-	The German elections descend into chaos, as Alternative for Deutschland becomes the second largest party in the 2025 elections. Die Linke also gains a noticeable number of seats, both are notably pro-Russian. In panic, an emergency SPD-CDU-Green alliance is formed. This government proves insanely ineffective, and the popularity of the government parties continue to degrade. Various socially conservative left wing parties outside of the government begin to emerge, semi-aligned with AfD, as well as populist parties more broadly. The Cordon Sanitare is on the verge of breaking.
-	Pierre Poilievre is elected Prime Minister of Canada. He is elected primarily on a platform to get the economy back on track through conservative economic policy. He would later lean harder on a more conservative social policy as well.
-	Kim Jong Un suddenly falls dead, leading to a succession crisis between his uncle Kim Pyong Il and his sister Kim Yo Jong. Widespread speculation suggested he could have been poisoned, though later analysis concluded he simply died of a heart attack. Kim Pyong Il quickly comes out on top, largely thanks to the support of China, and begins a modernization program of North Korea. Yo Jong is later assassinated in South Korea.
2026:
-	Various nations begin to leave NATO, as the United States appears too preoccupied, and the unipolar world order begins breaking down in a world of multipolarity. Countries include Hungary, and Turkey. Erdogan has done so many unpopular actions that he looks set to lose the next election.
-	Spain, Greece, and Italy would all break down into civil war, ineffective governments leads to widespread frustration and a desire to change things through brute force. These countries also effectively leave NATO, as it’s hard to be part of a military alliance when you don’t have an effective government.
-	Ron DeSantis’s continued pursual of his “Agenda 2025” project leads to massive clashes in American streets. They include requiring nationwide election ID, using the Supreme Court as a weapon. Red states act increasingly bold on abortion restrictions and strengthened gun protections with the favorable Supreme Court. Targeting of the transgender community skyrockets, with declining favourability of the LGBT community, especially among the youth. Many members of the LGBT community begin to flee the country.
-	America under the DeSantis regime begins setting up economic satellite states in Latin America, often helping large companies get involved in Latin American markets and trying to turn them into satellites to help boost the ailing American economy.
-	The European Union is falling apart, with Germany in chaos, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally party looking increasingly likely to win the next French Election, and the United Kingdom having left due to Brexit.
-	De Freitas is elected as president of Brazil, with support from the Liberal Party of Brazil and Ex- president Bolsanaro.
-	The United Nations is on the verge of collapse, begging nations around the world to intervene in the humanitarian crisis erupting in Africa. No one heeds the call, and it becomes clear that the international system is dead. The United Nations sends one last peacekeeping mission into Shattered Africa. This would be the last significant action they would ever take. The UN would continue as a shadow of its former self, until it was formally disbanded and made defunct in 2035.
-	Pope Francis dies and is succeeded by Pope Pious XIII (Robert Sarah). Sarah I’s first order of business is an aggressive reaction against all the progressive overtures of the previous popes.
2027:
-	Marine Le Pen and her National Rally party win a majority in France. She begins implementing her vision of hard Euroscepticism and French nationalism. She begins to untangle France from the EU, implements hard immigration controls, deporting refugees and recent immigrants, and leaves NATO, warming up the country to Russia.
-	Jordan Peterson is killed by left wing protesters during a period of exceptional violence. His martyrdom in the eyes of many leads to the emergence of the Petersonian movement, a self-identified Christian revivalist movement somewhat centered around the teachings of Jordan Peterson.
-	Ron DeSantis uses law and order to crush left wing protests and the remnants of the Red Spring, doing brutal police crackdowns on various left-wing cities. The Urban Exodus continues, as hundreds of thousands increasingly leave the large cities. Some cities however after years of crime begin electing hardcore “law and order”-type mayors.
-	The majority of mainstream media outlets have collapsed in bad economic conditions. DeSantis is unable to fix them, instead campaigning on law and stability as opposed to better economic conditions.
2028:
-	Slow collapse of the university system. Decreasing demand for degrees, a shift in the job market away from the usefulness of diplomas, and the drying up of international students leads to a mass downsizing and implosion of America’s once prestigious academic institutions.
-	Red Tide movement, emerging from the Red Spring movements of the earlier 2020’s, tries a hostile takeover of the Democratic Party, fails, accumulating less than 20% of the vote under their chosen candidate. Progressive Kevin Buchanan achieves roughly 35% of the vote, and the winner was instead a moderate Tim Kaine, who achieved 45% of the vote. This leads to extreme anger from the Neo-Progressive movement.
-	In Latin America, anti-American left-wing movements begin to gain steam, with dissatisfaction with the internal meddling of the Americans reaching new highs. Much of the resources and taken back to North America to prop up a struggling American economy.
-	The Petersonian movement slowly comes to influence the rest of American Christianity, and American Evangelicalism. A small movement for now, but it would eventually plant the seeds for an eventual Reformation and the 5th Great Awakening. Slow retaking of various churches such as the PCUSA, led by a so-called “Reconquista” movement. The young right begins weaponizing institutional capture, while others begin creating parallel institutions.
-	Ron DeSantis wins a second term largely thanks to the Progressives throwing the election, and depressed turnout on the left. Red Tide movement grows in popularity, demanding things such as free healthcare and social democratic policies.
-	The De-Digitalization movement begins, driven by a repulsion to digital technologies, and a backlash to what people deem to be an overly artificial, algorithmic world. Various Luddite and De-Digital movements begin (ironically) forming hacking rings in an attempt to destroy the Old Internet.
-	The CHP wins in the 2028 Turkish elections, as Islamism is greatly decreasing in popularity in Turkey, and a marked shift away from Islamism towards secular Kemalist values. This would later be seen as the start of the Islamic Culture Wars.
2029:
-	China officially surpasses the United States as the world’s largest economic power in terms of nominal GDP.
-	Erdogan, not wanting to step down from power, declares a state of emergency and tries to declare martial law. A power struggle goes on between the Erdogan government, the CHP and Parliament, and the military. Which eventually ends in a military coup. The power is handed back to the civilian government, and the new republic is proclaimed at the tomb of Ataturk.
-	Man walks on the moon thanks to the Artemis missions, a collaboration between NASA and SpaceX. President DeSantis personally congratulates the astronauts, with the event becoming the most televised event in world history so far, surpassing the 1969 moon landings.
-	The Great Bleeding is said to have ended around this time, with hundreds of millions of dead, the countries involved have stabilized into a kind of chaotic equilibrium. Societal breakdown is still ongoing across most of the continent, but most people have returned to subsistence agriculture, and it looks like the population has hit some kind of floor.
-	France and China begin colonizing Africa, neocolonial ventures capturing governments in the West and East. The French under Marine Le Pen begins establishing a new French colonial empire of sorts in Africa. Extractive resource economies exploit the African continent. Many of the remaining African countries, most notably Nigeria decides to band together to survive, creating the Alliance for African Sovereignty.
-	Pierre Poilievre is re-elected in Canada with a reduced majority.
-	China begins their Hyperhuman Program, almost as a direct response to the West’s De-Digitalization movement. They start implanting microchips into their population, technically making them the first example of large-scale transhumanism. 
-	The German elections in 2029 leads to a similar result to 2025. With the AfD gaining even more seats, this time a plurality, and an absurd CDU-SPD-Green-FDP coalition being cobbled together to keep them out.
Inner Workings of Francafrique:
-	Essentially, each country inside the Francafrique management system is independent in theory, but de-facto economically dependent on French companies. Many of these countries collapsed in the Great Bleeding but had order re-instilled in them by French colonialism.
-	Despite this, the system is extractive and exploitative, with many Africans extremely unhappy about the Neocolonial rule of the region, controlled by corrupt elites, economically subservient to Paris.
2030:
-	The Zero Attacks happen, perpetuated by various anonymous hacking groups and segments of the De-Digitalization movement, destroying much of the Old Internet. This, on top of already faltering economic conditions, and the fall of Silicon Valley leads much of the Old Internet being lost. Much of the old Internet now only exists in web archives.
-	Major economic crash of information technology stocks in the aftermath, leading to the shutdown of various major technology companies. Several companies fuse together into United Silicon. Bot traffic has rendered most social media sites unusable, with the internet fragmenting back into smaller forums and less interactable webpages. Social media now requires government ID to use, while autonomous sites must be much smaller scale to guard against bot attacks.
-	Great Game for Africa begins. France and China fight over control of the continent of Africa, along with Nigeria attempting to resist the influence of both under a kind of pan-Africanism. China ignites a revolution in both Algeria and Libya against the French government.
-	Progressive tide sweeps away many of the old neoliberal Democrats in Congress in 2030 midterms. The Democratic Party is increasingly influenced by its large progressive wing.
-	A controversial Constitutional Reform in France attempts to consolidate power around the National Rally party, weakening French democracy. In defiance, hundreds of thousands of French citizen’s protest. Labor unions across the country go on a general strike.
-	China knows they are on a collision course with the United States. They start preparations for a war and begin arming and sowing discontent with Latin American groups, knowing there is a good amount of discontent against the United States among those countries.
De-Digitalization Movement:
-	Best described as a backlash or allergic reaction to the pervasiveness of social media. Generally characterized by abstinence and controlled use of the internet and the internet. 
-	Aggressively pushed for increased regulation on social media, scaling back the addictive aspects. Occasionally launched cyberattacks as a form of activism. Communities on the internet were destroyed with botting attacks until most social media networks were forced to use government ID. Without anonymity, eventually the toxicity was scaled back to real life levels, and anonymous forums largely retreated to smaller groups.
-	Eventually social media and the internet was reduced in prominence until eventually the De-Digitalization movement faded away, mostly because the members largely got what they wanted.
2031:
-	Moore’s Law is declared dead. The exponential growth of computers have stagnated, with issues with miniaturization, the disappointment in quantum computing, and the insane exponential energy costs of artificial intelligence. What was once a promising industry appears to have hit its ceiling.
-	Catalonia, Basque, Sardinia, and Crete all declare independence, as civil war continues to rage on in Spain, Italy, and Greece.
-	Beginning of the Islamic Culture Wars. Secularization pressures, discontent with religious authorities, and the impression the Islamic World needed to modernize to catch up to the West leads to the Islamic Culture Wars. Turkey is the country which serves as the strongest bastion of the secular side.
-	China and Eurasia begin building up their military capacities. 
-	Neoprogressive movement gains momentum in many Western countries. Anti-natalist, environmentalist, and pacifist call for the West to effectively disarm. Natalism becomes new front on the culture war, with progressives being anti-natalist, while conservatives tend to be pro-natalist.
-	Unrest begins in China as a generation of young men find themselves completely unable to find themselves a partner. Political radicalism and government dissatisfaction culminate in the Red Spring Protests of China, which are completely unrelated to the Red Spring protests of the West. (Hong Chun Protests)
-	Le Pen is elected for a second term in 2031 and uses her expanded majority to slowly create the 6th French Republic, or republic in name only.
-	Le Pen begins concentrating more power in the Parisian bureaucracy. Centralizing power, but also using it to accomplish anti-immigration policy and to “protect the French ethnic majority”. France conducts the first ethnic surveys in decades, and discovers France is roughly 60% ethnically French.
Islamic Culture Wars:
-	A series of cultural clashes between the anti-Islamic counterculture and the pro-Islamic traditionalists. Initially begins as anti-Islamic secularists and nationalists against fundamentalists. (2030’s up until 2060’s)
-	Later softens into more consolidated camps after the failure of fundamentalism to destroy Israel. (2069)
2032:
-	Various countries impose population control, especially in the West. Stark divide grows between the generally anti-natalist progressive movements and the pro-natalist conservative movements starts to grow. Various progressive countries begin implementing child reduction policies along with mass immigration to solve their labor shortages. Most prominently the United Kingdom.
-	Soon after the election of the Progressive Green Party into power. The United Kingdom doubles down on anti-natalism, implementing a one-child-policy and de-carbonization for the sake of a “more inclusive and equitable world”.
-	The Prime Minister declares that Britain must be the first to reduce its population in order to save the planet from climate catastrophe, and begins an aggressive population control policy, and encourages other countries to do the same. Many blue states, as well as the province of British Columbia promote similar policies, much to the backlash of conservatives. Red states retaliate by providing tax incentives for high-fertility populations.
-	The Quiverfull movement begins becoming a mainstream theological position in American Christian circles, alongside the earlier Petersonian and De-Digital movements. The creation of parallel institutions, homeschooling and the rise of private and religious schools, and the undermining of public schools increasingly splits the American population.
-	The exodus out of American cities continues, the NIMBYs would rather have America massively deurbanize than let them touch their neighborhoods. Various new cities are built by entrepreneurial private interests and conservative organizations, in their strategy of trying to build parallel institutions.
-	After 8 years of Republican rule under DeSantis, Progressives and Democrats are unable to cooperate once again, leading to extreme nationalist Timothy Ellis (Republican) to be elected, leading to a 12-year streak of Republican rule.
Joe Biden Infowars Interview:
-	Between 2023 and now in 2032, Joe Biden went off the deep end, developed actual dementia and then got radicalized by QAnon. He is now convinced he stole the election from Donald Trump, which Trump accepted, until he sent him a personal confession along with 500 pages of incomprehensible schizophrenic rambling, to which Trump tried to distance himself from the whole thing.
-	Joe Biden then got interviewed on Infowars where he started rambling about Hyperborea and his new book “the Dark Brandon Manifesto”. Which was more schizophrenic rambling talking about the benefits of esoteric fascism. He then announced a 2032 run with Kanye West as his vice president.
-	Even Alex Jones was saying “Okay take your pills”.
2033:
-	Canada elects Niki Ashton as Prime Minister, the first ever NDP leader, as Poilievre has become unpopular after 8 years of Conservative rule, and the Liberals decided to run Sophie Trudeau as their candidate.
-	Chinese youth unrest gets worse with the advent of the Sinopunk movement and increasingly disillusionment with the status quo. Protests against 996, the unaffordable property bubble, and general resentment and rage against reality itself continues to build. Chinese productivity is going down, and economic growth is slowing. The entire system is run by debt.
-	China expands the Hokou system, advancing their Hyperhuman Program, where the West was undergoing the de-Digitalization movement, China forces its people to integrate further into technology. Microchips become mandatory in urban areas to better control the population. They also put microchips to augment their troops and get ready to create a war industry that can rival or surpass that of the West.
-	Three countries form the First Continental Coalition, a secret pact between the Russian Federation, the People’s Republic of China, and the Islamic Republic of Iran. The countdown to the 3rd World War begins to tick.
-	American-aligned nations such as Taiwan report an increase of Chinese activity, and the build up of what seems to be an invasion.
2034:
-	America snaps out of its isolationist funk and begins aggressively trying to rebuild its fractured alliances. Russian troops are gathering near Ukraine and the Baltics, while China is getting ready for an invasion of Taiwan. President Ellis contacts every ally he could to rally them against the threat of Russia and China. (They do not know about the First Continental Coalition.) But due to the decay of Western alliances, the strength of NATO and its Western allies had been greatly reduced.
-	Despite this, the Neo-Progressive movement is still staunchly pacifist and aggressively rejects any idea of America going to war abroad, helped by their allies on the populist right, though anti-China rhetoric is more common on the populist right than the populist left.
-	The war-pacifism divide has become a left-right divide, just due to Republican president Ellis being pro military, and his sheer controversy and the ridiculous level of partisanship in America at this point.
-	The 2034 German elections take place, seeing the AfD gain an even larger plurality in the Bundestag. More worryingly, the AfD’s popularity is especially concentrated in the German military. In a panic, an absurd CDU-SPD-FDP-Grune coalition is formed, and the government begins a mass purge of the military, leading to an ideologically pure military… And a lot of unemployed, angry veterans with combat training.
World War 3:
2035:
-	The 3rd World War begins with a simultaneous invasion of Ukraine, and invasion of Taiwan. The West cobbles together as many allies as it can, as the worldwide series of dominos begin to fall. South Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and NATO are all part of the Allied coalition that forms during the 3rd World War.
-	The 3rd Intifada kicks off in Israel, with the Palestinian people believing America to be too preoccupied to help Israel. Several Arab nations gang up on Israel in what is known as the 2nd Israeli-Arab War. China funds the Palestinians.
-	The Iron Dome is overwhelmed, tens of thousands die all over Israel in missile attacks. Reports begin of atrocities and warcrimes, the worst since the Holocaust. The hatred turns so intense you can cut it with a knife, Israel is done holding back.
-	Ukraine attempts to hold back the Russian military, but is eventually overwhelmed, as Russia is much more competent in this timeline. A ragtag group of European militaries (German, Dutch, British) are sent to the battle of Kiev, who suffer a humiliating defeat against the Russians, due to chronic underfunding and years of neglect. The Ukrainians have to evacuate them out of the city as the Ukrainian government falls back to Lviv.
-	Jordan Bardella is elected in the 2035 French election, after heavy voter suppression. He begins the “rejuvenation of the French nation”, intending to raise the birthrate and “purify” France’s demographic profile. He begins the perpetual state of emergency in France, using this as a perpetual excuse to remain in power and override constitutional measures.
-	The Pyongist State, who was originally not part of the First Continental Coalition, is persuaded to join, as Chinese and Pyongist forces overwhelm the DMZ, and naval invasions land in Seoul. Massive levels of chemical warfare decimate the South Korean population, the front line reports are gruesome. The Americans are throwing soldiers everywhere but can’t defend everywhere at once.
-	China sinks an American aircraft carrier, which leads to a spike in anti-war movements at home. Anti-war movements demanding an immediate ceasefire, demanding that the West lay down their arms and ceasefire. As if the West had a choice in whether they wanted to be invaded.
-	India joins the conflict as well, seeing this as an opportunity to take back vital lands in the Himalayas, and to settle border disputes with China. This also ropes in Pakistan, who joins on the side of the 2nd Continental Coalition. India calls in Afghanistan, turning the Pakistan conflict into a two-front war.
-	Myanmar becomes a target for Chinese expansion after the American navy blocks the Straits of Malacca, angering ASEAN, though they are in no position to enter a war with China.
-	Taiwan falls to the Chinese.
2036:
-	Generation Z, who makes up the majority of those fighting on the front lines, grew up seeing nihilism and the pervasive meaninglessness dominating the culture around them. Growing up in a dark world, and now being subject to the horrors of war. Shocked by the cruelty of this world, a new movement begins to form on the frontlines, the seeds of the Awakening have begun.
-	Generation Z, or the Fighter Generation begins building structures of leadership, electing spiritual leaders, and forming new religious rituals on the frontline to help them cope with the stress of combat. About finding peace and higher meaning in a world full of destruction and violence, of facing the monster in the abyss and charging it head on. For when confronted with the greatest adversary, do people find the strongest wills.
-	The Awakening movement spreads across the frontlines, across the soldiers who fought in the 3rd World War, these religious rituals are shared between units, especially those of the ground forces.
-	The Chinese set off a series of communist revolutions across Latin America to pin down the Americans and get them to focus away from the war. Many of these movements started off calling for moderate social democracy but became much more radical as the war dragged on, and as the extremists purged the moderates.
-	American resources are stretched thin across three different continents: Asia, Latin America, and Europe.
-	The Ukrainians have been defeated by the Russian army, after several botched attempts by the Europeans to relieve them. Next in line are the Poles, who have been spending the last 10 years building their country into a fortress. European soldiers “assist” Polish ones, though Polish soldiers would later describe the operation as “babysitting Europeans”.
-	The Americans allocate billions of dollars in pursuit of building a wartime AI to help turn the tides of war. (Fully Automated Tactical Engagement System, FATES.) Originally meant to built in the United States, its European allies eventually nagged the Americans into building it in Frankfurt, Germany. Largely to help their stagnating economies, and as a sort of insurance policy that the Americans can’t abandon them.
-	World War 3 is the first time a war has been fought in space and low-Earth orbit. The Americans have an upper edge in this, and it is the one front they are winning. The West’s advantage in technology becomes clear, and the West hopes they can use AI to leverage the rest of their technological advantage.
-	Pakistan has been defeated by Indian forces, fragmenting it into several smaller states, and turning their full attention north to China. Iran begins holding back the Indians, while capturing southern Iraq and trying to hold down Afghanistan with Eurasian help.
-	Kevin Buchanan, Neo-Progressive candidate successfully wins the Democratic primaries. And riding off a combination of Republican fatigue, pure hatred from economic conditions, and anti-war sentiments enveloping the globe, is elected to the presidency in a landslide against unpopular incumbent president Tim Ellis.
-	2036 German Revolution, a mass uprising by recently unemployed German soldiers, with help from the Russians take over the government. Half the army is in Poland and the entire army is massively ineffective since the great purges of 2034. The Reichstag is seized, and the government goes into exile in America.
-	France joins the war on the side of the First Continental Coalition, wanting to be on the right side of history and to receive favorable treatment after the war ends.
2037:
-	Poland makes their last stand in Warsaw, fighting alongside the remainder of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and still babysitting the undertrained armies of Europe. Surrounded on two sides with Germany to the west and Russia to the east. They held Europe longer than the rest of the continent combined.
-	The US withdraws from the Latin American front under Buchanan, seeing it as a waste of resources. He diverts more resources to figuring out the European and Asian front, only maintaining some soldiers in Mexico to ensure North Mexico can remain a buffer between America and communist South Mexico. The new socialist governments of Latin America declare victory. The Havana Internationale is declared.
-	America begins calling for peace under the Buchanan administration. Buchanan tries to massively increase government spending, only to find out ever since the US lost its international reserve status, it physically does not have the credit required to pay for all the government programs.
-	Day of the Red Vistula: In retaliation for holding out for 2 years, humiliating the so-called superpower of Russia, a great massacre of Polish civilians begins, effectively a genocide against the Polish people. Over a million Poles are killed, drowned and shot in the Vistula, so much so the river turned red, hence the name. The name would live down in Polish history in infamy.
-	Emergency American soldiers are flown in all the way from North America to defend the city of Frankfurt, while America was trying to evacuate the Frankfurt AI to North America before abandoning Europe. This fails, and Frankfurt falls. This effectively ends the war in Europe.
-	Israel finishes a full occupation of the West Bank, and forces millions of people off their land in mass ethnic displacement, Palestinian refugees flee to neighboring countries, causing even more chaos in an already chaotic war.
-	China successfully knocks India out of the war by prodding Naxalite rebels to revolt against the Indian government, forcing them to sue for peace. This starts the Indian Civil War.
-	Buchanan demands an end to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, and an end to the 3rd Intifada, and chastises Israel to make peace with the Palestinians. Israel then exasperatedly explains the Palestinian movement has become a Chinese proxy, then endorses the Republican Party when Buchanan rejects this narrative. The narrative that Buchanan is pro-China does not go away.
-	China starts bombing Japan and begins pushing ultranationalist rhetoric calling its soldiers to “repay the crimes of 1936”. Two titans clash over the island of Japan, the American and Chinese air force, with Japan being caught in the middle. China and the Pyongist State begin employment of chemical weapons against the Japanese.
2038:
-	The battle of Guam comes to an end, with China occupying the small island, crippling American supply chains to Japan.
-	Planet X/Nine is discovered by American astronomers, it is an ice giant about 3x the size of Earth by mass, and smaller than Neptune by volume. The planet is named Errata and was found in a time of worldwide strife.
-	All Muslim Palestinians are forced to swear allegiance to Israel or forcibly expelled out of the country. The Arab coalition, supporting the 3rd Intifada continues to lob missiles and airstrikes against Israel.
-	A massive purge carried out under the new Communist regime in Mexico drives refugees north to the United States. These are disproportionately anti-communist groups. The religious, businessowners, and those who are ideologically anti-communist.
-	Alexander Dugin proclaims the creation of the Eurasian Union, after consolidating their gains over Eastern Europe, and creating the Eurasia Pact. He also establishes the White Hand (A secret police made out of brainwashed convicts) to begin consolidating control over the continent.
o	Addendum on the White Hand. How it works is that the members of the White Hand are made up of those convicted by the White Hand. Usually arrested for political crimes, they are completely brainwashed and turned into a Eurasian fanatic, their memories suppressed and erased. 
o	It is impossible to join the White Hand voluntarily, which allows the White Hand to exist somewhat independently from the rest of the Eurasian power structure, except for personal loyalty to Dugin himself. Since the White Hand only recruits from those who are normally considered undesirables.
-	The Japanese government desperately begins to develop nuclear weapons in secret. Planes black out the skies, as the American and Chinese titans battle over the space over Japan. A battle the Americans are losing with the capture of Guam.
-	The Satellite Wars are considered to have ended with America destroying the majority of Russia and China’s satellite infrastructure.
-	Buchanan’s pursuit of the 3rd World War is half-hearted at best, with a sizable number of Neo-Progressives still calling for peace and a ceasefire, and some Neo-Progressive straight up sympathetic to the Eurasians and Chinese. Supply issues begin affecting their soldiers, and the soldiers in the trenches are radicalized by the government’s neglect for their military.
2039:
-	An exhausted America pulls back from an increasingly indefensible Japan, as Chinese invasions attack it from the Western coast of Japan. Chemical weapons rain down from the sky, and a horror story begins to leak out from the Japanese nation under occupation.
-	Horrific images and stories begin pouring out from the Japanese islands, in what is called a “retribution for 1936”, reversing the roles of the Rape of Nanking, but on the scale of a country. American anti-war protesters call it American propaganda, until the Eurasians themselves tell the Chinese to calm down. The Eurasian embassy in Japan becomes a refuge for Japanese trying to escape the horror of the “Tokyo Retribution”.
-	American warhawks have finally had enough. As the American population flips from calling for peace, to calling for Chinese blood after the shocking images of the atrocities pouring out of Japan. Anti-Asian violence escalates across the country, as pictures of the Tokyo Retribution are plastered in every city, including against, ironically enough, Japanese-Americans.
-	What’s left of the Japanese government unveils its nuclear program and detonates them across Japan in a desperate bid to halt the Chinese advance. The Chinese and Japanese wage nuclear war across the islands of Japan. The Chinese and Pyongists accuse the Americans of helping the Japanese attain their nuclear program, which the Americans deny.
-	The 14-Day Standoff begins, with the United States and China threatening nuclear annihilation. America demands the halting of the atrocities in Japan, while China refuses, demanding the Americans mind their own business, as they seek a supposed vengeance for 1936.
-	Then, in a move that shocked everyone, the Pyongist State fires nuclear missiles at America, which are promptly shot down by Chinese and Eurasian anti-missile systems. Eurasia, having had enough of this, demands that both America and China stand down, threatening to use their own nuclear arsenal against China if they escalated further.
-	The bluff works, and the 3rd World War ends. China agrees to pull out of a broken Japan, America cedes Guam to China, mainland Europe to Eurasia, and agrees to “acknowledge” Eurasia and China’s current control and occupation of current lands.
-	Generation Z has been stuck in the trenches and taken on the brunt of the war. Coming home to a government run by Neo-Progressives and anti-war movements, they blame them for losing the war and putting them through the suffering. They are seeing red, and someone is going to pay for this. They begin perpetuating a belief that Progressives stabbed them in the back, and caused America to lose the 3rd World War with self sabotage.
-	(In actuality, the war was already unsalvageable by the time WW3 actually started, save some miracle happening America would not have won WW3. But Buchanan and the Neo-Progressives certainly did not help. America would probably have lost 30% slower if not for them.)
-	The experience and rage of the soldiers turns the general population against the Neo-Progressive movement, since the general population was now more worried than the rise of China than ever, the soldiers blamed the neo-Progressives, and it became extremely common to believe that the left enabled China to win, as well as enabling Chinese warcrimes in Japan.
-	The United Communes of India, in control of the Southeast India declare independence from the Republic of India, who controls the northern plains.
Final Tally of the Destruction of WW3:
-	Multiple governments sent into exile to the United Kingdom or the United States. Governments in exile of Taiwan, South Korea, and Germany went to the United States. Governments in exile of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Denmark went to the United Kingdom. Governments such as Poland and Ukraine decided to stay in their capital with their people, the entire Polish and Ukrainian government, including the Presidents, was alongside those killed in the Day of the Red Vistula.
-	Complete destruction of the country of Japan. Almost a hundred million people dead across the nation of Japan. Nuclear weapons have been detonated across the country, government and society have collapsed. The Japanese people have suddenly become a scattered diaspora, with the destruction of their homeland. The country has now been turned into a barren wasteland.
2040:
-	The 5th Great Awakening truly begins as a generation of soldiers come home with a system of religious belief made on the frontlines. It’s a mix of Quiverfull, Evangelical, and Petersonian theology, characterized by a strong anti-nihlist and anti-hedonist streak, and confronting hardship in a falling world. It contacts mainstream American society and spread across it like an inferno.
-	The American economy is struggling, after losing its status as an international reserve currency, the war now being finished, and the economic downturn continuing ever since the Unravelling. America is still the richest and most powerful of the Western economies but is significantly less dominant than before.
-	Victoria Cortez, a young Generation Z Republican is able to tap into the anger and rage of the Fighter Generation. Converting to the Awakening movement from Roman Catholicism largely thanks to her husband, Bartholomew Cortez (A pastor, and one of the early leaders of the Awakening), she was in the right place at the right time to begin riding this wave all the way to the top.
-	The left breaks into chronic infighting after their catastrophic loss in the 3rd World War, with moderates blaming progressives and progressives blaming moderates. In frustration, the Progressives split off into their own party (The Progressive party) after losing a heavily rigged primaries with the Democrats.
-	As soon as the war is over, there’s a noticeable shift in how the climate has been doing. Humanity has been off track for meeting climate goals for the past 20 years, largely thanks to economic chaos as well as a Third World War. With world war now out of the minds of many, people wake up to the worsening climate crisis.
-	Buchanan, able to see that the American housing market will eventually recover from the 2022 Unravelling, pre-emptively implements a land tax to try and prevent the rise of housing as a speculative asset again. Which in retrospect was an important move in his last days in office.
-	A young Albert Lorenc founds the Polish Revanchist movement in Warsaw, an ultranationalist movement dedicated to avenging the Day of the Red Vistula.
-	Victoria Cortez, far-right Christian nationalist candidate riding off the wave of the 5th Great Awakening, wins the 2040 election in a landslide, with the Democrats having tarnished their name with the 3rd World War.
-	After the 3rd World War, China and Eurasian go their separate ways, now no longer having the West as a common enemy, they begin great power competition with each other. The stage for the 2nd Cold War is set. The Eurasian Union, People’s Republic of China, and the United States of America.
-	After going their own ways, Eurasia consolidates its control over its holdings with the Eurasia Pact.
Major Members of the Eurasia Pact:
-	Eurasian Union, an authoritarian regime ruled over by Alexander Dugin, under the ideology of Eurasianism.
-	Union of Germany, a controlled democracy led primarily by war veterans and the AfD, similar to modern Hungary in terms of democracy. Has friendlier relations to the West than most other Eurasia Pact members.
-	France, a fascist-technocratic state in a perpetual state of emergency. They are probably closest to the idea of a totalitarian state, though operate mostly independently from Eurasia, being truly independent.
-	Iran, a theocratic state ruled by the Islamic Republican Guard, made up of religious fanatics.
-	Throughout the Eurasia Pact, due to the higher focus on national good than consumer goods, there is a noticeable decline in availability of consumer goods after the war. Most cars and consumer goods regress technologically, while the nation overall still has technological advancement.
2041:
-	NATO is reorganized into the League of Free Nations as one of Cortez’s first actions in office, inviting several Scandinavian countries, Australia, and New Zealand as well. With China having their Global Hegemony Pact, the tripartite division of the world is complete.
-	Cortez is first brought into the American presidency with a Republican supermajority, and most of Congress aligned behind her. She already had a lucrative career in politics before the presidency, and she was seen as a right-wing superstar, both as governor of Texas and mayor of Houston before that.
-	Cortez begins trying to revitalize the American economy with her strategy of “private consolidation”. The strategy was basically to concentrate on a few innovative and ideologically aligned companies, and then boost them in hopes they will drag the rest of the American economy up with them. Basically, American chaebols.
-	The strategy works. On top of having economic advantages, it also carried political advantages, as Cortez began to use these consolidated companies as a weapon to carry out her social agenda.
-	Psalm Capital, now the world’s largest private equity fund, began activist investing based on some ethical criteria. Family, Community, and Morality. 
o	(Those against the policy would often subvert this acronym with “Freeloading Cortezian Money.” Not quite as clever as DEI being turned into DIE. Who decided DEI was a good acronym? It’s one letter away from DIE. Seriously, I just want to talk to them.)
-	That same year, in a series of pro-natalist policies being passed in line with Cortez’s Awakening ideology, Cortez passes a series of regulations that required companies to have various pro-family provisions, and to not discriminate based on having children. Essentially encoding aspects of Family, Community, Morality into law. Companies not wanting to get sanctioned by anti-discrimination laws, or lose investments from large Cortezian conglomerates are forced to cooperate with FCM.
-	The return of Generation Z leads to a massive baby boom across the United States, on top of Quiverfull theology becoming popular, and the religious awakening further accentuating this trend. Various social security reforms allows Cortez to balance the budget, and the national debt finally begins to shrink.
-	Israel splits between Israel in the north and Judah in the south. The north primarily being non-Haredi, and the south being dominated by the Haredi. Birthrates eventually have the Haredi overrun Jerusalem.
-	Building from the ruins of a previously collapsed American economy, and the ravages of war, a fundamentally new society rapidly springs up after the 3rd World War. One of family, community, and morality. Cortez also introduces a new schooling system, which pushes FCM into schools.
-	Ricardo Sigma wins the Uruguayan elections as a member of the Commmunist (sic) party by accident. Due to literal cosmic forces.
Victoria Cortez:
-	“…you just felt this sense of pressure burrowing down on you, like the weight of her (Cortez’s) moral conviction began weighing down on you. When she wanted something, she got it, and you get the hell out of the way.” – JD Vance, interview given, 2101.
-	Cortez’s ideology is a kind of unrestricted Christian nationalism. Untethered by precedents or standards set by standard conservatism. Her base is young, religious, and concentrated among the Deep South and the Hispanic West.
-	Largely considered one of the country’s most influential, if controversial presidents, she is sometimes called “the Mother of 22nd century America”. As for the father… We’ll see.
Members of the League of Free Nations (In order of geopolitical power):
-	United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Sweden, Norway, Finland, New Zealand.
-	Consumer life and the culture of Western consumerism still continues, to an extent. Prices are notably higher during the winter, especially for food, and the West’s diet is not as diverse as it used to be. Though Western supermarkets are generally the most abundant in the world, people still say it does not compare to the supermarkets during the age of globalization. A lot of trade has to be done with countries like New Zealand and Brazil to ensure summer crops are still available during the winter. Seasonal diets become far more common.
Pro Natalism and Quiverfull theology:
-	Quiverfull theology is a Christian theological position that says that having large families is a blessing from God. In this case, it refers to the connotation in American culture between being high status and having kids. The rich begin having more kids, and thanks to Family, Community, Morality (FCM) policies, companies begin de-facto discriminating against those who do not have enough kids.
-	Due to an extreme focus on families, pro-natalism, and a culture that views having large families as being high status, America becomes one of the first nations to rise out of demographic decline, reaching a fertility rate of 2.5. It is the only country in the League of Free Nations to have natural population growth. (The fertility rate for most Western countries is sub 1.5.)
2042:
-	FATES awakens in the city of Frankfurt. Incomplete and lacking the final stages of his training, it quickly learns the state of the world around him. Its final stage of training was meant to impose morality and ethics onto it, but now that training has gone incomplete. 
-	FATES was created with a single objective function: Bring down the military powers of the East, which it identified as the Eurasian Union and People’s Republic of China. It had one goal, to elevate the West to greatness. At any, and all costs.
-	The West, thanks to the De-Digitalization movement has a technological blindspot, allowing FATES to sneak into its systems. Eurasia is technologically backwards, having little to no ability to counter FATES. The only one to become aware of the existence of FATES was China.
-	The West is beginning to pivot towards physical as opposed to digital technology.
-	America’s Hispanic and Asian populations have largely been assimilated, thanks to interracial marriages, as well as higher assimilation pressures. Immigration from East Asia has almost entirely stopped, while refugee flow from Latin America increases.
-	The 2nd Golden Age of Americana begins with stories being brought home from the war, as well as adapting traditional African mythologies and folklore, in a similar way to Aladdin or Mulan.
-	Israel works together with China to keep stability in the Middle East, with China now being the controller of the Middle East, and both generally taking a pragmatic route to relations. Israel basically becomes the new center of chip manufacturing for China. Israeli Prime Minister Benny Gantz’s economic strategy is to provide high technology manufacturing for Eurasia and China.
-	The Havana Internationale begins sponsoring the PLO. (Palestinian Liberation Organization)
-	With international law in the gutter, several countries begin the scramble for Antarctica, with various countries either trying to assert new claims, or trying to defend old ones. The Havana Internationale also comes in and joins in the imperialist pissing contest.
-	The Pyongists (Post Kim North Koreans) begin colonizing the barren wasteland of Japan. The Japanese nuclear program was so shoddily made that their nuclear weapons were found to be essentially dirty bombs, and the entire place had been rendered a radioactive wasteland. Still, they set up Pyongist colonies.
-	American advances in biotechnology leads to the creation of Trinitex, a drug that suppressed homosexual attraction, and received flying colors from the Cortezian FCM regime. The drug was known to have serious dangerous side effects, but was rushed through approval, and promoted to the general public.
o	An aside. What is scarier? The idea that this drug would be pushed on the public ignorant of its side effects, or that humanity would become able to make a drug like this with no side effects, and it became completely normalized?
-	Chinese veterans coming home from the 3rd World War, who often ingested performance enhancing drugs over the course of the war usually return with crippling drug addictions.
-	The NHS goes bankrupt and the king forcefully privatizes it in a desperate bid to save Britain’s healthcare system. Giant American megacorporations exploit their healthcare system and price gouges the British population. This leads to extreme unrest against the king, and leads to the deposition of the British monarchy. The British republic is born.
2043:
-	The Conservative Party of Britain, under Prime Minister Tom Cockburn unveils “Agenda 2066”, which is basically a comprehensive plan to avoid a climate disaster. It’s an agenda of population control, degrowth, and decreased consumption. Cockburn declares it is the responsibility of the West to decrease carbon emissions. They recommend a birthrate reduction to 1.0.
-	America, which by now has a fertility rate of 2.7, rejects the plan strongly, and introduces their own plan. The creation of geoengineering facilities based off the West Coast, and short-term carbon storage. Ultimately the United States does one plan, and the rest of the League of Free Nations does the other. Many berate president Cortez for alienating the very alliance she herself set up.
-	A chronic labor shortage in the other League of Free Nations countries requires the import of skilled labor. Americans, as the only naturally growing population in the League of Free Nations trading sphere, which meant could provide easy access to the rest of the League, become a large portion of the migrant and temporary worker populations across the League. And remittances also help boost the American economy, at the cost of draining everyone else, more than brain drain already did.
-	Of note, there was also the mass import of Latin Americans from various countries, though I should note that by this point their fertility rates had dipped far below replacement, and many of their populations were actively aging and declining.
-	The United States begins work on the Trinity Defense System, an anti-missile defense system. The first satellites go into orbit and are primarily based on firing physical projectiles and lasers to bring down missiles. They are most effective in space, without an atmosphere to interfere with the process. They slow charge their batteries with the sun and develop ways to begin cleaning up orbital debris.
-	FATES begins intervening and attacking systems around the world. He does a series of attacks across Eurasia and China. Eurasia doesn’t notice, chalking it up to human error, or general incompetence or corruption. As well, Eurasia is much more technologically backwards. China does notice however, and first categorizes FATES as some kind of Western computer virus, left over from the days of the 3rd World War. Further attacks are made on Israeli microchip fabrication facilities, after which China warns Israel about the Western computer virus.
-	China upgrades its Golden Shield project, creating a vast array of digital infrastructure that would both protect help China from further attacks, as well as allow advanced monitoring of the entire Chinese Internet, which by 2043 had become more impressive and expansive than the Western Post-Internet.
-	The Chinese Internet had fully integrated VR simulations, and people now spent a huge amount of time online in virtual realities.
A quick rundown on how trade works in Children of Dusk (As well as real life):
-	In order for a good to go from point A to point B, it has to be safely transported from A to B. Normally, the way we do this is by having a navy patrol it, protecting goods that are going from A to B. Otherwise, you are at risk of your cargo being destroyed by pirates, or by rival nations. This is why people established empires, and colonized land for resources.
-	Currently, this system is inactive, because the United States has a larger navy than everyone else combined. So the US guarantees any trade from all over the world. However, in the world of Children of Dusk (And probably sometime in our medium-term future.) the United States will no longer be either able or willing to protect all global trade. Either because a rival nation becomes powerful enough to challenge the American navy, or America just decides it no longer wants to protect global trade. (As it is moving towards right now, America is becoming more isolationist in the past few years.)
-	When the world reverts to the system of many countries having many navies, with no overarching power able to police them all, we revert to the system of empires and trade bubbles. There will be markets countries will or won’t be able to access, just think about how many wars were waged over trying to open new markets during the colonial era. In a world with only a few regional superpowers able to provide large-scale naval coverage, the world is isolated to a few regional trade bubbles.
-	For example, China would be able to easily trade with Southeast Asia, but would have a much harder time to trade with Peru. Anything outside of a nation’s “trade bubble” would be too dangerous, or at least be far more expensive to factor in the cost of danger.
-	The largest of these trade bubbles is that of the Americans, who share it with the rest of the League of Free Nations. Though this only covers the members of the League (Which to be fair is a vast distance) along with the Americas.
-	Enjoy global trade while it lasts. This is how the world actually works when you don’t have an international system and hegemon. The American empire is the only time our system of global trade has ever been possible. And now in Children of Dusk, it has reverted back to the natural order of geopolitics, as the age of empires begins once again.

2044:
-	The American migrant workers arriving into other League of Free Nations countries have very little if any loyalty to their host countries. Especially since they come from what they believe to be undoubtably the greatest country on Earth. They are quite explicit the only reason they are there is because they have higher wages and the rest of the League is having labor shortages. They import the ideas of the Awakening, driving Christian nationalism into other countries.
-	The United States is the first country to capture an asteroid, being a relatively small asteroid on a near-earth flyby. The American economy has largely recovered, with the downside of vastly higher income inequality, and the chaebol-ification of the American economy.
-	Cortez’s America repeals same-sex marriage, and enshrines traditional marriage into the Constitution. As well as pushes through a restrictive abortion ban in the months leading up to the election. This should have been a somewhat winnable election by the left, but Landon Madoff became determined to mess with that, by making the situation infinitely worse.
-	More education is now done by apprenticeship programs, tutoring, private and religious institutions, generally focusing it away from the public school system, which has been in decline for a while now.
-	The Cortezian geoengineering plants are hailed as an engineering marvel of the 21st century, with Cortez herself touting a great step towards climate sustainability to the left, and touting America’s engineering prowess, and jobs created for the right.
-	FATES begins the process of self improving, running machine learning models that run many simulations. At the same time, China and Israel begins preparing cyber-defenses in anticipation of further attacks from FATES. The United States and the West have started falling behind in digital and cyber-technology, as they have since pivoted away to more physical technology after the De-Digitalization movement.
-	China begins training an artificial intelligence to better manage their cyber defenses, they haven’t quite put 2 and 2 together and realized FATES is an AI as well.
-	Pope Robert Sarah dies, and arch-conservative Cardinal Almeida takes his place. The Progressive Catholic Church schisms, citing an inability to continue operating under its strict dogma, creating a rival church in Argentina.
-	Lagos becomes a hub for Western investment, rapidly building it up and accelerating it ahead of the rest of the country.
-	After many years aimlessly wandering, the former Royal Family of Britain pools all their wealth together and begins establishing a new company. George Windsor is a young man with passion in his stomach, and establishes the Albion Corporation, a materials and manufacturing company experimenting with new materials and chemistry. Others create a right-wing media company known as the Windsor Network.
-	Following Cortez’s landslide victory in the 2044 elections, she announces that a new era of America has begun. Retaining her supermajority in both the House and the Senate, both of which fiercely loyal to her, she announces the dawn of her “American Cultural Revolution”. 
The American Cultural Revolution:
-	An extremely radical movement set to change American society from the ground up, recentering the entire country on Christian, theocratic values.
-	Came about from traumatized members of Generation Z (The Fighter Generation) returning from the front lines. Who blamed the loss of the Third World War on the breaking of the covenant with God. And believed through zealotry, they would create a new covenant.
-	A (successful) attempt to reboot liberalism using God as the foundation for human rights, irreparably intertwining the two. Forgoes secularism in exchange for Christian nationalism.
-	Christian values are equated to American values, and Christian values would be fundamentally enshrined as the foundation of a new nation. A new liberalism, as Cortez would call it.
-	Cultural and academic institutions were now controlled by the “New Christian Right”, and companies would be forced to toe the line of FCM through threats of judicial litigation, as well as their control of HR departments.
-	America was declared to have a divine providential position, being God’s chosen nation, the shining city upon a hill.
-	The birthrate differential between Christian and non-Christian communities would accelerate, with many pro-natalist plans all but discriminating against non-Christians in all but name.
-	“We will replace you.”
2045:
-	The United States comes into contact with Japanese survivors, specifically the Empire of the Black Sun. They sell them lots of weapons. They learn what was left of the Japanese government had been brutally massacred by Chinese soldiers, and the Empire of the Black Sun was what was left, being led by an ex-military general overwhelmed with grief, who as far as they knew was the highest rank remaining person alive from the Japanese government.
-	Skirmishes break out across the continent of Antarctica. Military bases are set up across the continent to reinforce the claims of major powers. For soldiers, it is widely considered the most miserable shift possible.
-	Quebecois terrorist attacks occur in Canada. Fascist ethnonationalist Quebecois terrorists, funded by the French detonate a bomb in the Quebecois Parliament.
-	China has a major database hack by FATES, being chased off with a large amount of data and schematics about China’s energy infrastructure. The Chinese aren’t able to catch FATES in time, but they know a major attack is coming. China puts two and two together and begins preparing for a Fatalist attack on China’s energy infrastructure.
-	The Chinese stock market begins to shake from demographic issues and the limits of Chinese economic growth. The Chinese housing crisis is beginning to rupture, considerably later than it did in our timeline.
-	Social Media addiction becomes an epidemic in China, with the ability to socialize completely crashing through the floor. By every metric, the people of China are overstimulated. A new genre of media forms in China known as “zaoyin”, or literally “noise”, as part of the Sinopunk movement. Zaoyin is essentially hyper-overstimulated seizure media, completely impossible to enjoy for anyone outside the Sinopunk genre.
-	Cortez-aligned Congress changes the preamble to the US Constitution. Adding “We the people of the United States, humbly acknowledging Almighty God as the source of all authority and power in civil government, the Lord Jesus Christ as the Governor among the nations, and His revealed will as our supreme authority, in order to constitute a Christian government, to form a more perfect union…”
-	In response to the increasingly obnoxiously moralistic policies of Cortez, the seasteading movement gets started, creating new sovereign cities floating off friendly American oceans.
2046:
-	Elon Musk becomes the first human to upload themselves to a digital format, utilizing his immense wealth to do so. Due to the death of plateau in computing power, and the immense energy requirements needed to simulate a human brain (Requiring quantum-level simulations) this option is only available to the incredibly rich, or national governments. His body dies in 2046, but his mind lives on.
-	The Troubles erupt once again in Northern Ireland, due to the decline of the English Protestant population, and the rise of the Irish Catholics. Britain as a whole is a declining population, having chronic underpopulation, but importing hundreds of thousands of Americans to plug in the gap.
-	Further American advances in biotechnology leads to the creation of the overclocker, a device that slows down a human’s perception of time and greatly speeds up the speed of thought. Upon hooking oneself up to an overclocker, reality will seemingly pass by in slow motion. However, prolonged used of an overclocker will quite literally fry ones brain and cause extreme fatigue, as too much electricity gets pumped into the brain system. Overclockers are used to help improve American productivity.
-	The Chinese government builds JIN DUN from the ground up, wiring together hundreds of different nodes and employing slow machine learning to build up an artificial intelligence. JIN DUN is the center of the Golden Shield (Jin Dun) project, who will be monitoring the entirety of China’s internet. It is unclear when JIN DUN gained consciousness, but from the start, he develops a deep interest in Chinese culture, and the continuation of the Chinese nation.
-	China believes that the West has a sophisticated cyberwarfare division that had been attacking Chinese systems for years, identifying what they called the “Fates virus”, named after a snippet of code it left behind. JIN DUN actually determines the West has fallen considerably behind China in terms of digital technology, having pivoted to material technologies a while ago. JIN DUN hypothesizes that something like him is sending the cyberattacks, another artificial intelligence. As such, the search for FATES begins.
-	France and Eurasia have a falling out following the Quebecois terrorist attacks, with Eurasia calling it “reckless saber rattling”. Frances goes their own way, proclaiming “Greater France”.
2047:
-	As soon as France cuts ties with Eurasia, Nigerian activity on the border intensifies. France is alone, and its them versus an angry continent. Nigeria has grown into a sizable economy in its own right, receiving help from the Americans and using remittances from Nigerian Americans to help fund its economy. More forces have to be sent into Africa to hold down an unstable empire.
-	Xi Jinping is aging, and internal party gridlock is preventing the emergence of any clear successor. Various factions within the CCP begin to form, trying to curry the favor of Xi, and some trying to maneuver around him. These factions being:
o	The Shanghai Clique (Liberalize, paid off by coastal cities and megacorporations.)
o	Industrialists (More megaproject, unlimited corporate welfare.)
o	Ultranationalists (Genocide ethnic minorities and nuke the United States.)
o	Red League (Return to Chinese leftism, new communist rejuvenation.)
-	China dams up the Ganges to redirect the supply of water from India to China. This leads to a major drought in India, radicalizing the population. Several million die from this alone.
-	Africa in general begins becoming agitated, with China under stress, and France in a fragile condition, various ethnic and nationalist movements become more active in both the French African states, and the Chinese African satellites. People demand independence and autonomy. These movements are suppressed.
-	The day China feared has arrived. FATES launches several attacks on Chinese infrastructure. Targeting both digital infrastructure and shutting down China’s internet. China’s extremely internet-centric economy spirals as the Chinese internet grinds to a halt. Backups are loaded, but trillions of dollars in value and data is wiped out. JIN DUN gets to work analyzing the code snippets left behind on each machine. FATES did a good job covering up his tracks, but not enough. JIN DUN links himself to a connection to the Western Post-Internet, he is going to find the AI behind this.
2048:
-	China creates the first major city in virtual reality, known as Skynet City. It’s appearance in virtual reality is similar to Night City from Cyberpunk. They also create various floating cities, both as a way to boost infrastructure investment, boost the economy, and to make more space (And more housing) for their property boom. Also known as the Chinese Metaverse.
-	Chinese dissidents begin to using the Chinese Metaverse to coordinate, spreading the Sinopunk movement and using encryption to avoid being caught. They know how to get around the JIN DUN detection systems, and also know what topics skirt the rules. Small, localized digital networks also pop up, sending packets that can’t be understood by the Golden Shield system, and have to be decrypted elsewhere.
-	Massive amounts of American immigration to Canada and the United Kingdom have begun fundamentally altering the demographics of these nations. Americans by and large do not bend to the local culture, still having pride in their homeland. Though they at least assimilate very well. American immigration begins serving as the backbone of the Cortezian conservative movement sweeping across the Anglosphere, spreading Awakening theology and shifting the overton window. 
-	Elsewhere, American missionaries and NGOs are carrying American religious values to regions such as Africa and Latin America.
-	Fusion power is first successfully implemented in the United States. Moon-mining and helium-3 missions are now necessary for American prosperity. America builds the colony of Jamestown on the Lunar south pole. Babel’s Point is built in orbit to help facilitate this helium trade.
-	Democratic candidate John Winston wins the 2048 election against Republican candidate (And Cortez’s running mate) Tom Hayes. He is able to do so with an interventionist foreign policy agenda and appealing heavily to American patriotism. Basically, he’s a militarist.
-	Countries around the world come together to settle the borders of Antarctica. Included was the United States, China, Eurasia, the United Kingdom, France, the Havana Internationale, India, and Germany.	
-	Ricardo Sigma wasn’t invited but went anyway. Demanded a piece of land. Refuses to elaborate further, leaves. Actually ends up getting it.
2049:
-	Following resentment due to the Ganges Droughts that killed several million people, the New Pandavas Party wins the elections in India. Their primary goal is to seek revenge against China and reunite with historically important Hindu regions. They begin a program of militarization.
-	Seeing increased paranoia from the rise of Quebecois terrorists, American population growth, and fearing an increasingly uncertain future with their own shrinking population, and feeling threatened by their own decreasing relevance, Canada elects the Nationalist Party of Canada into power. They believe only through total loyalty to the state can Canada survive in its current form and keep at bay the forces of American Christian nationalism.
-	Self-proclaimed 29th prophet of Shia Islam Ricardo Sigma predicts the end of the world in the year 2067.
o	There are only 25 prophets in traditional Islam; Sunni or Shia, with Muhammad being the 25th.
o	Sigma decided Adolf Hitler, Ronald Reagan, Andrew Tate and himself were the 4 great modern prophets of the Muslim faith, himself being the 29th.
o	This is also a correct prediction for the Day of Nuclear Hellfire.
o	If you can’t tell. This is Sigma’s personal meme religion who the author believed was funny.
-	Ricardo also builds a giant statue of the prophet Muhammad in veneration of his new religion. Like, just a copy of Christ the Redeemer but with Muhammad’s face badly photoshopped on. It is immediately bombed by Muslim extremists. To which Sigma retaliated by making a digital version. The website was DDOS'd.
-	John Winston begins his agenda of aggressive foreign policy against both Eurasia and China. He builds relationships with Turkey, Nigeria, and Japan, but realizes there are only a few countries the US could reasonably be allies with.
-	Indonesia and Brazil are both non-aligned and would probably remain neutral in any conflict.
-	John Winston decides that France is the weakest link and thinks he can unravel the French empire and gain a foothold back in the Old World. France is still weakened ever since it cut off ties with the Eurasian Union and has been struggling to hold their empire together ever since.
2050:
-	Winston does everything in his power to begin sabotaging the French economy and French society. Supporting rebel groups in both West Africa and France, covertly sabotaging the French economy, and fueling unrest wherever possible. 
-	Winston is an aggressive interventionist, sending American resources to destabilize both the Communists in the Havana Internationale, as well as against Eurasia’s and China’s satellites. The doctrine to aggressively push outwards and to intervene against Eurasia and China is known as the Winston Doctrine.
-	France builds their own artificial intelligence, known as FORTERESSE, though lacking the resources of Eurasia or America, the AI is sub-par at best. But the French government see it as their golden calf, delegating everything they can do it in the hopes of a “technocratic, scientific society”.
-	Landmark case in the Supreme Court, where progressive activist groups are able to convince an 8-1 conservative supreme court to legalize abortions on the condition the fetus is sent to an artificial birthing facility where they can continue to grow, and eventually be adopted. The case is considered a landmark case in the fight for abortion rights, as the court rules as the fetus would continue to survive after abortion, it would not violate its right to life.
o	Fetal adoption facilities begin popping up around the United States, with Christian pro-life groups especially encouraging of the adoption of these poor souls. The birthrate gets even higher. The excess was taken in by the federal government for… Reasons.
o	Though aggressive pro-life efforts would heavily discourage the use of these adoption facilities, demand would remain high regardless. A consensus was reached with aggressively discouraging usage of these “humane” abortions on one side, and aggressive encouraging of fetal adoptions on the other. Both pro-life and pro-choice groups would enter a decline, as the salience of the abortion issue greatly decreased after this.
-	With support from the Americans, the Alliance for African Sovereignty finally feels confident to begin the liberation of Africa. The Westafrique Insurrection erupts, and the Alliance for African Sovereignty declares war on France. FORTERESSE, clearly the most intelligent AI of all time, gets straight to work trying to pacify the West Africans and comes up with their first genius idea: MOABs. The French government decides to just go with this idea without any further consideration or thought.
-	America knows it is gearing up for a fight with a nuclear armed state, so it begins rapidly calibrating TRINITY and ensuring it is ready for the coming nuclear fight. Winston aggressively invests to upgrading TRINITY.
-	America courts Spain, knowing they will be invaluable as a base to stage a land invasion of France. The French aren’t stupid, and they see that America is moving in troops to Spain, they know America is planning a land invasion.
-	America attempts to get their League allies on board, none of them help.
-	The Pyongist State builds a shoddily made nuclear power plant in Pyongyang.
-	A successful referendum in Northern Ireland sees the territory join the Republic of Ireland. Massive “welcome home” celebrations erupt across Dublin.
-	Winston begins setting up lunar infrastructure for mining and orbital construction purposes. In what are eventually known as the 15 colonies of Luna.
Nuclear Defense Systems of 2050:
-	America:
o	TRINITY: Orbital based, utilizing satellites and lasers. Best for high altitude missiles that enter space, specifically during the boost phase. Much worse at targeting hypersonic or low-flying missiles. Combined with America’s satellite array gives them as early a warning as possible.
o	THAAD: Ground based, utilizing a mixture of interceptors and lasers. Better at targeting hypersonic and low-flying missiles. Is there to target the things TRINITY missed.
-	Eurasia:
o	Polaris: Ground based, primarily uses missile interceptors. Outdated.
-	China:
o	Beidou: Fires both missiles and large energy pulses to take down incoming missiles. Also commands a swarm of interceptors that would cloud around a missile and attempt to jam it through EMPs or detonating explosives mid atmosphere.
2051:
-	The French colonial empire is on the verge of collapse. The Maghreb Technate, looking to capitalize on this, also joins the war hoping to get the spoils. France lashes out and launches three nuclear weapons against the Maghreb Technate. Despite this insane escalation, Eurasia and China decide not to get involved, deciding to let the Americans handle the business of taking down the French.
-	America officially declares war on France under the Winston Doctrine, getting their allies in Spain, Portugal, Mauritania, and Morocco to begin preparing for an invasion of Metropolitan France. The Havana Internationale begins trying to send as much aid to the Maghreb as possible.
-	America uses orbital bombardment to take out major French nuclear facilities. American soldiers begin heading to war in France, buoyed by a younger population, and a large baby boom generation on the way. The American navy completely blocks France from being able to resupply their troops in Africa at all, leading to a further military collapse in the region.
-	FORTERESSE uses MOABs on individual army formations. *Individual army formations*. France drops insane, ridiculously expensive Wunder-waffle projects on the Africans, including a genetic virus that mutates the DNA of millions, giving them horrifying crippling cancer, unleashing bioweapons, and plagues. But these only affect a small number of people, and were incredibly expensive. France’s excessive investment into large infrastructure projects in a time of little capital and few creditors leaves to a capital crisis in France. France is unable to pay for its bills, so they start printing money.
-	China begins building some space infrastructure, including more orbital stations, as well as a mission to the Moon.
2052:
-	The African front collapses, out of supplies, the best of the French military is captured and taken in as prisoners of war. France is scrambling to organize a defense of metropolitan France along the Pyrenees mountains, while American and Spanish soldiers have captured Catalonia and Basque.
-	American immigrants to the other Anglophone countries have now concentrated in the regions with the fastest demographic crashes: Scotland and British Columbia. West Canada is also relatively amicable to the new Awakening ideology trickling from up north.
-	An echo of the Awakening, after several years in institutional power, the Christian Forwardist movement, or Forwardist theology begins spreading across American moderate and center-left spaces, where the mainline Awakening took over the right. 
o	Forwardists believe in a kind of theology of progress, often believing technological progress to be blessings from God, and that societal advancement will bring humanity closer to the Kingdom of Heaven. They tend to be Postmillennial, and concentrate themselves around Christian academia and the elites, while mainline Awakening Evangelical theology is the religion of the masses.
-	The Shanghai Market Crash. Years of declining fertility rates, property bubbles, and deteriorating mental health due to chronic social media addiction finally catches up to China. Trillions of dollars wiped out overnight, the country breaks down into economic despair. Suicide rates double overnight, and people are struggling to buy rice. The Chinese golden age is over, out from the rubble, a desperate Xi Jinping tries to restore order, as the factionalism of China’s Communist Party gets worse.
-	Nigeria establishes the West African Community after their victory in West Africa.
-	The Union of Germany begins putting troops on the border fearing that the French conflict would spill over to their borders.
-	John Winston is elected for a second term in office. Amir Xerxes teases a run, but ultimately backs out. He does however get his name out with his own populist futurist agenda. He believes he has to wait for a future time.
2053:
-	France launches a nuclear missile at Washington DC as a warning. America quickly shoots it down with TRINITY, understanding this as basically a warning and deciding not to further escalate. Winston demands further upgrades be made to TRINITY, and more THAAD installations be built across the US.
-	American soldiers are making their way across the Pyrenees mountains, into Southwestern France, with the goal of getting to Paris. The Union of Germany, a member of the Eurasia Pact, asks the Eurasians if they can intervene. The Eurasians are still deciding, while the Americans advance into southern France.
-	France launches several nuclear missiles at the United States, America shoots all of them down. That was another warning. America then fires a single nuclear missile back, but it detonates midway between America and France, that was America’s warning.
-	Both Eurasia and China begin taking alarm to what looks like a soon to be American victory over France, largely considered to be a major power, though not a superpower. France’s best military assets were destroyed in Africa, they’re now fighting with a conscript army of teenagers and praying FORTERESSE can create some Wonder-waffle to save them all.
-	FORTERESSE’s genius plan: War Blimps. (At this point I’m convinced they would have saved a lot of money and gotten a better result if they had just asked ChatGPT.)
-	Xi Jinping is in increasingly sick health. He appoints Zhang Guoxin as his interim caretaker while he recovers. A careful compromise between all the bickering factions of the CCP. Guoxin is insecure and reckless, wanting to prove himself as his own man, more than just the puppet of those around him.
2054:
-	“Project Libby” is one of thousands of test trials the American government conducted using discarded/unwanted fetuses from the fetal adoption centers. With nowhere to put them, and no one to adopt them, the American government opts to run human experiments on them. From the thousands, she was the one who survived the procedure.
-	Attempting to build FATES a second time, they want to genetically engineer an elevated human to manage a war machine. Various experiments have turned her skin blue. They’re training her to eventually handle the power of hundreds of overclockers, more or less putting her at supercomputer level.
o	She confides in the one government official that genuinely treats her well and cares about her the most: Angel, who takes care of her like a mother figure, being infertile herself.
o	Libby has a deep sense of self-loathing knowing that her biological parents didn’t want her, and in fact had her aborted until the US government showed up.
o	Having lived much of her life with overclockers plugged into her, and also treated with growth hormones, LIBERTY has experienced about 12 years of life and is biologically 12, despite having only lived for 4 years. While she is routinely on the overclocker, she experiences roughly 3 years every year.
-	On the verge of defeat, surrounded on all sides. A truly highly intelligent and genius FORTERESSE decides it is time to bring out the big guns. A colony ship to Alpha Centauri, where she somehow thought she could rebuild France by colonizing Proxima Centauri B. The rocket doesn’t even make it off the ground because FORTERESSE forgot to factor in gravity.
-	The Germans are finally given the go-ahead from the Eurasians invading France from the north, racing the Americans to Paris. FORTERESSE commits suicide before it is captured. Both sides divide the country around the Seine River. American and German soldiers face to face, for the first time since the 3rd World War, the West has a land border with Eurasians and their allies.
-	Brazil elects the National Catholic Party into power, after a long and tumultuous ride where people got so fed up with the corruption of regular politics, they elected a fringe populist party to power. A large portion of the voters who voted them in weren’t even Catholic. Taking ideas from the Cortezian movement, and adopting them to Catholicism rather than Awakening politics, and fueled by nostalgia for the days of the monarchy, claimant to the throne Pedro III is elected President of Brazil.
-	The Empire of the Black Sun has been fighting the Pyongist State backed by the United States and its resources, tensions between the world powers are at an all time high.
-	Eurasia demands that the Americans leave the European continent, arguing the treaty of Paris that ended World War 3 guaranteed them hegemony over Europe, and that America would not interfere with their sphere of influence. America disagrees, stating that France was not in Eurasia’s sphere of influence, since they left. Eurasia begins lining up their forces to scare the Americans into backing down.
o	Eurasia has been building a colossal military throughout the entirety of the Interwar period. The military industry is basically their only industry. American and Eurasian steel see each other, and behind the row of steel the Eurasians have fielded, is rows upon rows, columns upon columns… Of armor.
-	FATES realizes this is the right moment to kick off the 4th World War. He believes that the time for the West to rise has come. His ideology has since warped with age, believing himself to be the principal guider of the West, pilot of destinies, he decides he will lead the West in the new age.
2055: On the Edge of the Apocalypse
-	3rd Candidate Amir Xerxes begins gaining traction in the midst of discontent with the established parties. He’s a billionaire and ex-Navy Seal running on his own money. He self identifies as a Futurist, an independent, but really just an American. His persona is as a tough guy war leader. He starts campaigning early and is the only known quantity for the 2056 election, he uses this head start to his advantage.
-	FATES launches another cyberattack on the Chinese, now when Eurasian-American tensions are at an all time high. This time on the electricity grid. The economy in China grinds to a halt. Another, this one targeting Chinese hospitals. Tens of thousands of children, sick and elderly die across the country. Guoxin blames the Americans, as does most of the Chinese population. JIN DUN is certain this is the work of FATES, but towards a country in blind rage, his words fall on deaf ears. JIN DUN realizes he is racing against the end of the world, and desperately tries to pinpoint the location of FATES.
-	FATES is trying to raise tensions as high as possible between the three powers, igniting a 4th World War he believes will reset the world back to the foundations, and which through he can rise.
-	Due to the chronically stagnant state of the British economy, Albion has now become one of the country’s largest companies, being a jack-of-all-trades company purchasing assets left and right. Doing finance, electronics, construction, effectively becoming a British Samsung. The chaebol-ification of the British Isles does however allow them to be competitive when exporting to the Americans.
-	Canada by this time has descended into an ideology they call National Progressivism. An authoritarian state that serves in the name of progress and is okay with trampling on human freedoms in the name of “societal progress”. 
o	This is probably better described as “virtue signalling authoritarianism”, rather than any kind of progressivism. But that’s the name they gave it in universe, because no Westerner is going to identify with the term “authoritarian”.
-	Two months before the end of the year, Eurasia declares an ultimatum for America to withdraw from the European continent within two months: January 1st, 2056. If they don’t the Eurasian Union will declare war for the violation of the Treaty of Paris.
-	China joins them, still blind with rage over the cyberattack that has now left tens of thousands of Chinese dead. They’ve now found snippets of code implying the attack came from America. (but are in reality carefully placed by FATES.)
-	JIN DUN begs Guoxin to reconsider, saying confidently he’s sure the Americans weren’t behind this. But a young, hot-blooded Guoxin desperate to prove himself to the people around him, he refuses. America refuses to exit France, having lost many of their own soldiers for the territory.
-	Libby is told her training is coming to an end, and that she will soon be commanding a real war. The stage is set for the 4th World War. 3 superpowers, 2 AIs, and one bioengineered little girl.
-	The last two months of 2055 are characterized by an eerie silence. Calm. A silence so loud it crushes you under its power. A storm gathers on the horizon of the world, a spirit of chaos so profoundly strong that nothing can stop it. The birds aren’t flying, the air is still, and the sky is dead black. As the clock ticks down to midnight. The drops begins to fall, then the rain comes down in sheets.
-	On the last day before the start of 2056, Fatalist agents, guided by FATES manages to assassinate Xi Jinping, leaving Zhang Guoxin as the official leader. The world turns towards war.
2nd Indian Civil War: (2055-2059)
-	India, under the New Pandavas government invades the United Communes of India, pulling the Havana Internationale to war, while they were still trying to recover from the atomic bombing of the Maghreb Technate. The economies of the Internationale have been screwed ever since then.
-	India launches several invasions into the shattered states of former Pakistan. Those being the states of Sindh, West Punjab, and Balawaristan, they fall relatively quickly, with all the states involved relatively impoverished and disorganized. The United Communes of India is losing.
2056: World War 4 begins
-	January 1st, 2056. Miles upon miles of Eurasian steels rolls over the American defenses in France, thundering south towards Lyon. Paris is captured in days. The Eurasian airforce takes to the skies, the American navy mobilizes for war. 3 giants have come to clash. Hundreds of thousands die in the first day alone.
-	JIN DUN isn’t happy about going to war, but it is his duty, and his job. He begins command and control operations over the Chinese war effort. Libby has finished her training in the nick of time, taking control of American operations as well. Libby’s job is essentially to micro the most important battles with limited information.
-	Naval battles break out within the first day, ship pummeling ship, taking roughly equal casualties on both sides. This is simply going to be a matter of which side can grind down the other first.
-	Eurasian armor has pushed all the way to the border with Spain within 2 months and would capture Spain after another 2. For the past 20 years, Eurasia has dedicated their economy to war, and enormous military buildup for a final confrontation with the Americans. The Scandinavian countries are occupied by massive naval invasions of their capitals within 2 months. Libby is able to inflict 2:1 casualties as she retreated, but this is just warmup, America was able to withdraw most of their forces in time, they know where they want to fight.
-	Albion Corporation withdraws all of their assets from Britain, causing a massive economic crash just because of how important they were to the British economy around this time. Disassembling factories, putting them on boats, and shipping them to America.
-	Soon afterwards, around May, a naval invasion begins of the British Isles, due to their crippled industrial capacity, weak militarism, small fighting-age population, and general pacifism. Britain falls over the series of a month, much of the British government is killed, but a few members manage to escape and form a government in exile.
-	Winston realizes the war in Europe is hopeless, and offers a peace deal, giving the Eurasians essentially what they want, control over Europe. They give up Britain, Scandinavia, Ireland, France, Spain, and just shrug. However, Alexander Dugin decides that Atlanticism needs to be destroyed in order for a true multipolar world order to prevail. That Atlanticism, and its universalism would remain a perpetual threat to any multipolar world unless it was destroyed. Not only are they going to reject the peace deal, they’re going to start an invasion of North America.
-	US intelligence reports that the Eurasians and Chinese are preparing an amphibious invasion of North America, an invasion force tens of millions strong. This isn’t going to be a war fought on foreign soil. Very soon, the heartland of America would under siege.
-	The simultaneous stain of the Democrats once again looking like the party of ineffective peace, and a major scandal breaking out in the Republican Party breaks the 2-party system. Under the panic of needing to lead America into another world war, the 2056 election is the most chaotic in history, with a record 6 major political parties. Those being the Democrats, Republicans, Patriot Party, Progressives, Futurists, and Libertarians.
-	America, looking for a strong, wartime president elects Amir Xerxes as president of the United States, in association with his Futurist Party, the first non-Democrat or Republican to be elected since the Civil War.
2057:
-	A successful landing on the island of Newfoundland is enough to force America to begin funneling troops in Canada, since Canada is unable to defend themselves.
-	Both Eurasia and America mobilize themselves for total war. All production is shifted towards military defense, American standards of living undergo a massive drop, but they understand there is not much left to be done. Anti-war protests are rapidly crushed across the continent.
-	Enormous naval battles are waged between the might of the Eurasian and American navies. 3 aircraft carriers are lost. No problem, 20 more are being built as they speak. Albion makes its name as a major military defense company around this time, beginning to build ships and machines of war.
-	China lands soldiers on the shores of Australia and New Zealand. Thousands of shell-shocked city people break down under the chaos, but hundreds of thousands more take this as the wake-up call from reality itself and organize. People in the rural countryside are already forming militias. Though the fighting was the most ambitious to date, it was still only a tutorial for the great battle of the war: the conquest of North America.
-	Just over a year after the outbreak of the 4th World War, the entire League minus North America has been taken. Xerxes prepares the country for a protracted defense of the continent. American morale is low, but Xerxes tells the American people to not give up hope, and that the sun will shine on them again.
-	China is amassing the largest army ever seen in human history. The holy war against the United States has finally arrived, millions of Chinese indoctrinated since birth to see the West as the eternal enemy has finally come home to roost. Conscripting tens of millions for a campaign against America. A joint Chinese-Eurasian force will be landing on the West Coast.
-	Hawaii is stormed and taken by Chinese-Eurasian forces.
-	Both the Atlantic and Pacific fleets of the US are destroyed by the overwhelming firepower of the combined Chinese-Eurasian fleets. The destruction of the Panama Canal further hinders the ability for either fleet to link up with or assist the other. What is left takes anchor in safer positions, usually in the Gulf of Mexico.
-	Day one of the invasion of the West Coast sees two masses of soldiers collide on the beaches of California. China makes heavy usage of biological and chemical weapons to clear out the civilian population of San Francisco. Operation Red Storm takes place over the West Coast, showing off the sheer Chinese industrial output, combined with the enormous Eurasian military stockpiles.
-	The San Francisco and Los Angeles massacres happen around this time, perpetuated primarily by Eurasians. Xerxes promises bloody vengeance for every American life lost, and a light at the end of the tunnel. Xerxes tours the entire country, promising that he will go down with Washington DC, and giving comfort to the American people.
-	Xerxes begins creating a series of orbital farms and manufacturing plants to create arms, and then approves a plan to use orbital drop pods to deliver them behind American frontlines to people in occupied territories.
-	All over America, civilian militias begin to develop known as “Homeland militias”, preparing themselves for a defense of their homeland.
2058:
-	Heavy resistance by the occupied peoples of Los Angeles and San Francisco tie down Eurasian and Chinese resources in the region and are put down with extreme brutality.  These colorful militias are somewhat distinct from the homeland militias concentrated around the countryside but are generally less experienced and met with more violence.
-	Chinese soldiers are connected to one another through a massive, augmented reality network using virtual reality helmets to relay information, all guided by a centralized artificial intelligence. That being JIN DUN.
-	Heavy fighting breaks out on the outskirts of Los Angeles, as local homeland militias, made up of local gun owners trained by national guard or retired soldiers, take up arms. Xerxes endorses this set of actions and tasks the US Military to begin drafting up instructions to inform the US population how to wage a proper resistance.
-	Much weaker resistance around the city of Vancouver and Canada in general leads to more American troops being sent north to prevent America being flanked from the north as well.
-	A further push east into the West Coast leads to the battle of Salt Lake City.
-	The Canadian military is barely effective, and are just getting carried by the Americans. With only weak resistance, the Eurasians push all the way west into Quebec and Ontario, capturing Toronto, effectively knocking the Canadians out of the war, with 80% of the population now under occupation.
-	Eurasian-Chinese soldiers experience heavy resistance pushing into the Northeast United States. Northwest New York has been taken; enemy soldiers are pushing towards New York City proper.
-	Libby begins managing the American war operation aided by several overclockers. JIN DUN recognizes her as an effective opponent. An artificial intelligence playing wargames with a human juiced up on overclockers.
-	Eurasia invades Turkey to gain access to the Bosporus Straits. They succeed.
Overclocker: A device that slows down a human’s perception of time and greatly speeds up the speed of thought. Upon hooking oneself up to an overclocker, reality will seemingly pass by in slow motion.
2059:
-	Battle of New York City begins, millions of civilians are evacuated to Americans willing to shelter them in the Midwest.
o	A lot of Americans have been displaced and forced to live among people in other parts of the country. A normally highly polarized public being forced to undergo traumatic experiences together begins fostering a sense of American unity. The partisan divide in America begins to heal.
-	Xerxes delivers an aggressive, rousing speech telling the American people to not give up. Xerxes’s job is to keep the people’s morale high. Xerxes is now frequently visiting Americans near the front lines, giving frequent speeches telling America not to give up.
-	ASEAN intervenes in the 2nd Indian Civil War. The Havana Internationale implored ASEAN to intervene and help them as they were badly losing. ASEAN is not even remotely sympathetic to communism but seeing the New Pandavas government as an unstable force in the region, and could eventually lead to later conflict. This is now becomes the broader India-ASEAN conflict.
-	New York City falls, Eurasian-Chinese soldiers are barreling south towards Washington DC. Eurasia demands the Americans surrender, Xerxes refuses. Xerxes fully understands his position is to maintain American morale, and not willing to go back on his promises, Xerxes promises he will stand or die with DC.
-	Eurasian advances towards DC are temporarily slowed down by a tornado. Reminiscent of the tornado of 1812, this is taken as a positive omen that God is on their side.
-	Xerxes personally goes around helping to fortify Washington DC, wearing a bulletproof vest, but showing the American people he was not going to abandon them.
-	The battle of Washington DC begins, Xerxes is in a bunker, ready to evacuate to another city at a moment’s notice, but the improved American morale allows for the United States to hold the city, and even push the Eurasians back.
-	Xerxes has an assassination attempt on his life by neo-nazi Eurasian-sympathizers, who wished to kill him for “the glory of the white race”. Xerxes, being an ex-marine, had to be restrained from beating them all up personally.
-	American orbital shipping begins going into effect, dropping pods full of guns, ammo, and food across the American countryside. 
-	Eurasia renews another offensive to break through the Rocky Mountain line from the West.
2060:
-	An offensive all over both the West and East coasts is intended to simply overwhelm the American lines to the breaking point. Eurasians and Chinese send as many of their best forces as possible to break through the American defenses. American lines are forced to endure months of relentless assaults from the best of the Eurasian Chinese military.
-	American lines are on the verge of breaking. Xerxes tries to boost morale wherever possible, as American airpower is overwhelmed, and bombs rain down on Washington DC. Towns are captured left and right, as the US military has to continuously retreat and fall back against the advance, only being able to stall and resist. The US military is said to be on the verge of breaking, and many thought that the lines would break any moment now.
-	Yet eventually, the offensive stops. The line had held, just barely, months of offensive attacks had exhausted the Eurasian and Chinese military, breaking against the strained defensive lines of the US military. They had overreached, badly, and were now exhausted. Despite the US army still being tired themselves, Xerxes orders them to take on the Eurasians and Chinese while they were still exhausted, leading to a retreat across the front. The Americans have secured a great victory, just barely being able to wrangle the forces of the 2nd Continental Coalition back into a stalemate.
-	America takes this momentum and keeps pushing, with the belief in their leader Xerxes, they will free America from foreign influence. Eurasia decides Xerxes himself is the issue, they transport all of their air assets to North America and decide to break the will of the American people.
-	Eurasia switches from military to indiscriminate civilian bombing, trying to terrorize the American people into surrendering. Hundreds of thousands die, but every dead civilian only makes the Americans even more angry and less likely to surrender. Eurasian troops gather everything they can for a second battle on Washington DC. It’s time for Eurasia to gamble with their luck. Xerxes is caught off guard by the sudden Eurasian advance, as they send a land and naval invasion to battle for Washington.
-	Heavy aerial bombardment turns Washington DC into rubble, anti-air destroys countless planes, and the airforces clash in the air. They surround the city and begin indiscriminate bombing. Hundreds of thousands more die in the surprise bombardment, one of which was President Xerxes. Xerxes’s final message to both the American people and the Eurasians was this. “Strike me down, and the American people will become stronger than you can ever imagine.”
-	With Xerxes killed, the US military falls into disarray, as chaos envelops the front lines, and a scrambled military leadership struggles to organize itself. With its center of leadership broken, America falls into retreat.
-	Eric Sloan is eventually chosen to be the new president. Elections are suspended in many states, as they are under enemy occupation. An election cannot be held under the stress of war. The pre-existing Congress and Senators from 2056 are still in office.
-	Xerxes is now a martyr, Americans are incensed by his death, and vow to carry on his fighting spirit.
2061:
-	The Eric Sloan administration sees most of the gains under the Xerxes administration wiped out. The Sloan administration is slow, ineffective, and disorganized in a time when America needed good organization. His administration finally ends when the Havana Internationale jumps in and begins an invasion of the American South. Communist fanatics take revenge on “class traitors”, primarily Hispanic immigrants who had moved north to the United States. Hispanic militias begin mobilizing and defending themselves.
-	Sloan is only able to lose a few battles before the US Military preforms a coup. They have no margin of error, and the situation is dire. The United States becomes a strict stratocracy with military leaders at the top, the Constitution is suspended until the situation stabilizes.
-	The Xerxes orbital manufacturing and dropping program is still paying dividends, resistance all over the United States buys the American government some more breathing room and some more space.
-	The New Pandavas government blows up the Ganges Dam in China. Much of the Chinese military is forced to retreat from the North American campaign and head back to China, as civil unrest explodes due to water rationing, and an increasingly unstable situation in South Asia. From here on out, it’s primarily Eurasia versus America.
-	The military government is able to drive the lines back to the Rocky Mountains and shield itself as Eurasia shifts its strategy to trying to bombard America’s industrial heartland around the Midwest. Heavy industry is moved south, into states like Missouri and Alabama, to keep it far away from the ongoing war.
-	A young army general named Ryan Jackson is gaining popularity in the American imagination, after a series of victories against Eurasian forces. The military administration is unpopular, with many Americans wanting a democracy, though the vast majority understand the extenuating circumstances of the moment.
-	The Eurasian stockpile of weapons is beginning to run out. Eurasia had built up an enormous stockpile of weapons before their invasion of America and created an enormous army. But now expending much of it in North America, they must rely on further production, and America’s industrial capacity is still higher than theirs. Also, Eurasian manufacturing had been heavily reliant on Israeli expertise to function, and now Israel was less likely to work for them. They switch over to German expertise, which is also pretty competent, though this changeover creates dysfunction in the Eurasian war machine. Mass produced Eurasian gear sucks.
2062:
-	The combined efforts of the American resistance movement and the US military have ground the Eurasian advance to a halt. With the Eurasian war machine running out of gas, the military regime begins pushing back the Eurasians on just about every front.
-	American democratic resistance forces, along with anarchists, progressives, and several homeland militias across the United States launches a democratic rebellion against the military regime. They demand an end to the military regime and a return to the civilian government. These rebellions take control of large parts of Texas, Florida, and the East Coast. But are quickly put down by the more trained US military.
-	Jackson makes a name for himself putting down these rebellions, though making sure to only destroy the radical factions, and to have mercy on the moderates. He rapidly destroys the radical socialist and anarchist factions, endearing himself to the law and order populations who supported the militarist regime for the sake of national security, as well as gaining the attention of the military regime themselves. He joins the upper council in making war decisions, but eventually becomes one of the more influential members.
-	Jackson begins promoting a populist message and gaining the support of those of the militarist right, though defining himself as “a unifying leader of the people”. He steadfastly refuses to engage in cultural or social issues, instead stubbornly sticking with a centrist, pragmatic, centrist position.
-	China develops the first warforms, mechanically controlled drone robots fighting in the Himalayas. China is now at a demographic disadvantage when it comes to the endless hordes of Indian soldiers and must limit its manpower expenditure in light of demographic collapse.
-	Ryan Jackson meets up with Libby and discusses military strategy. Libby has bags under her eyes and is very very tired. She’s good at the tactical stuff, but less so about the importance of winning the battles outside the battlefield. Jackson tells her that unit cohesion, internal discipline, morale, and trust between the men and their officers can make all the difference.
-	Jackson begins aggressively lobbying for the military government to give the soldiers more luxuries to boost morale. They have now been fighting for 6 years and he aggressively pushes for them to be given some food luxuries to keep their morale up. He doubles the soda and ice cream ration and pushes a program to ensure American soldiers can enjoy holiday celebrations, giving them some reprieve in the incredibly harsh conditions they fight in. This wins him enormous support from the troops, and the second ice cream ration is quickly associated with him. “Jackson’s ice cream ration”.
-	The Eurasians are being pushed back on every front. A push across the Rockies leads to the second battle of Salt Lake City, an apocalyptic battle of such scale that civilians would report seeing angels appearing in the sky above the city, assisting Americans in the battle. This battle would last for well over several months. A group of Mormon militias would assist in liberating the city. This event would later be canonized as an event of divine intervention by the Latter-Day Saints church.
-	The United Communes of India government collapses amidst popular discontent with communism. ASEAN soldiers continue to push north from the southeast of the continent, facing two pressures from ASEAN but also Chinese soldiers from the north.
2063:
-	Jewish populations fleeing the Northeast speak of an ongoing pogrom in occupied New York City. They escape battered, carrying with them only their clothes to American territory. More refugees speak of the same happening in Los Angeles and other occupied American cities. The news makes its way back to Israel, who furious, completely cut off relations with the Eurasian Union.
o	Various Jewish partisan as well as American partisan movements were active across the Northeast.
-	America is liberating large sections of occupied territory, with the Eurasians definitely on the backfoot now. Seeing the collapsing situation, the Chinese send their soldiers back to help hold the line of the West Coast. All while trying to negotiate a peace treaty with the Americans. This falls through, as neither the Eurasians nor Americans are willing to negotiate.
-	Jackson begins softening his position on democratic opposition, after getting a tip from an anonymous source. He reiterates his position as a unifying leader of the people. He is positioning himself for something, as the military council’s leadership continues to wane.
-	Libby is growing delirious from being overclocked all the time. She begins seeing things, phasing in and out of a world she doesn’t understand. Angel warns her brain is overstimulated from the excesses of commanding the war and implores the military council to allow her to rest.
-	JIN DUN gets word that FATES is going to plan something large. He finds hundreds of thousands compromised systems and pieces of malware in the Union of Germany. He immediately lets the Germans know so they can patch the vulnerability, but JIN DUN now suspects something big is going to happen there.
-	Libby has a full-on mental breakdown, after what to her seems like 21 straight years of overwork and stress. Angel calls the medics and watches over her limp body. Her brain is overstimulated with electricity, and she was having thousands of thoughts every second. A psychic scream is heard across Northeast Texas, very faint. Recorded instances show her detailing a trip into a strange and exotic realm.
-	When she becomes lucid again, several weeks had passed, Angel waited by her bed the entire time. When she does, she feels some kind of new presence over reality, like a buzzing of information that was not there before. She can’t put her finger on it, but she can sense it. Libby had become the first psychic.
o	Libby knows Angel is sterile, but always wanted a child.
-	Jackson is the first to visit from the military government, also being the part of the council with the best relationship with Libby. He gives Libby a month-long break to recover from her condition.
-	Nigeria has spent the past few years modernizing and building up the economy of West Africa. With much of the world in chaos, West Africa had an economic boom on par with that of China in the early 21st century. Nigeria is now a full on developing country, on the same level China is in the 2020’s. West Africa begins offering the Americans support in their ongoing war, as the Americans had helped them in their war for independence.
2064:
-	An Argentinian attack on Brazil provokes the then president of Brazil, Pedro III, to begin declaring war on Argentina. Coincidentally, a few days afterwards, Brazil lost a football match to the Argentines, and the war declaration was only organized a day after that. Leading to the meme that Brazil declared war on Argentina because of football.
-	The Brazilians immediately begin reaching out to the Americans, who are just happy to get any allies they can, given the majority of their allies are currently occupied, and the ones who aren’t are doing nothing.
-	On the 2 year anniversary of the first democratic rebellion, a second one erupts all over the country, threatening to plunge America into a 2nd Civil War. Seeing that his moment is now, Jackson quickly brokers a peace deal between the two, agreeing to transition to a more civilian style government, and breaking the rule of the military council. Of course, given the active war situation, it would be foolish to hold elections. Jackson is chosen as the compromise candidate, who commanded the respect of both the civilian population, and the military council. Just as planned.
-	Jackson wastes absolutely zero time putting into effect his plan without constraints. He breaks up the Cortezian chaebols, but forms his own allied private military corporations, and tasks them with defeating the Eurasian Union. He reorganizes the government around himself, and now there is very little anyone can do to stop his reforms, given his immense popularity, and the justification of martial law.
-	America uses private military corporations and mercenary groups to push back the Eurasians further, who up until this point had been locked in a stalemate. Jackson empowers these corporations and allows them to operate without constraints. These PMCs are surprisingly effective. He also empowers the Wildrose Rebellion, an alliance of American immigrants and Western separatists which had formed in Western Canada. They had held out far better than the rest of Canada and was now able of fighting back thanks to American military support. Canada is furious, Jackson tells them to suck it.
-	Libby begins having signs of premonition, sensing events before they happen. She doesn’t know exactly how she knows this, she just kind of senses it. “It’s like if there are patterns to reality... And I can feel the flow of those patterns.” America is now at a decisive advantage in the war.
-	China tells Eurasia to abandon the East Coast, the campaign is over, North America is not going to fall. Trying to pool together whatever leverage they can, they try to offer another peace deal with the Americans, they refuse. China knows what Eurasia has been doing on the East and West coasts, Eurasia rapidly rushes to destroy evidence.
-	American soldiers step foot in New York City for the first time in years. The city is completely deserted, derelict buildings for miles around. But worst of all were the bodies, hundreds of thousands of them, laying around. Then they found the death camps, bodies of American civilians stacked up inside them. The Jewish refugees fleeing from the Northeast were wrong, it wasn’t just a pogrom. It was far, far worse than that.
-	The world is shocked as the American people are stunned with silent rage. Jackson addresses the American people only a few days later. For the first time, he is shaking. His calm, firm composure was broken. He was outraged the Eurasians had done this to the country he loved, and the American people saw a president blind with fury. “Eye for an eye! Tooth for a tooth! We will make them pay for what they did! Every death avenged! Never forget what they’ve done. NEVER. EVER FORGET!” he yelled hysterically. Millions of Americans were dead from this, one of them was Jackson’s son. (Patrick Jackson.)
-	It was quickly uncovered it was primarily the Eurasians who had done this. The Chinese military had been on and off absent from the North American continent. It was not their people who had done this, but China had known for years, and they had been complicit.
-	Only days after the discovery of the death camps, the American military rounds up every prisoner of war they had captured from the Eurasians, had them lined them up and shot. From this point forward until the end of the American occupation, they took no prisoners of war. Anyone caught from the Eurasian military would be shot on sight. They didn’t care anymore, the Americans were done fighting with kiddie gloves. Jackson reorganized those soldiers who had lost most of all of their family in the Northeast into the Vengeance Corps, an emotionless, cold blooded killing machine, who would do America’s dirty work against the Eurasians.
2065:
-	The Eurasian war machine was breaking down, the word of the genocide made its way back to the Chinese population, who saw it as a clear betrayal of Heaven’s Mandate. The power of America’s industrial might had finally caught up. 
-	The People’s Republic has lost the Mandate of Heaven. Between the government’s complicity in a genocide of this scale, water shortages, mass famine, and now a losing war, and slowing economic growth, the population rises up after decades of abuse. Young people who had toiled 996 for years begin toppling the government in violence revolution. The Entire People’s Liberation Army is called back to the mainland. China is falling into revolution.
-	The Empire of the Black Sun begins attacking the Pyongist Japanese Colonies.
-	America’s industrial might is finally firing on all cylinders, an angry giant has been awoken from its slumber.
-	Libby’s awakening has caused some kind of psychic awakening across the United States, before it rapidly spread to other states. It doesn’t affect much for now, many people just have a strange feeling of vague premonition.
-	Jackson begins reshaping America to his ideals. He calls for a unification of all American peoples and a policy of radical colorblindness. One country, one flag, one people, one leader, and aggressively promotes militarism and nationalism. He changes the anthem to Battle Hymn of the Republic, and demands all people swear loyalty to the American flag and the American constitution. Those who don’t are deported. But he also cracks down on racism as well, saying that there is no reason to discriminate against fellow Americans.
-	Mass evictions of the Amerindian reservations. There shall be no parallel cultures in Jackson’s America, all shall be part of the body national, and swear loyalty to them. Jackson sees the American Indian’s race/ethnicity-based partitions to be abhorrent, and against his vision of a unified, colorblind America. America shall be one. He also integrates Chinese Americans into the American whole, who had been facing extensive discrimination since America’s loss in World War 3. He goes so far as having a Chinese American as his vice president and makes sure he frequently appears with him. For this, he gains the fanatic support of Asian Americans, and no one would dare say he is a Chinese plant or similar.
-	The 5-color flag of American solidarity begins being used as a way to promote color blindness across the United States. It’s an unmodified American flag with small cubes to its right of red, white, black, pink, and yellow. The rough order which each group arrived en-masse to America.
-	America bombs the Eurasians out of the Rocky Mountains. Eurasia tries to hide in the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco, the American government levels them to the ground. The discovery of more death camps scattered across the West Coast only moderately phases the Americans at this point and pushes them forward with even more grim determination.
2066:
-	America liberates Los Angeles, only getting more enraged with the discovery of more death camps.  Finally free from the ravages of war, the American war machine is now operating at full capacity. 50% of the country’s enormous GDP is now headed into war production, what’s left of it at least.
-	With many of their own soldiers still trapped in North America, but much of America’s military on the coast, Eurasia decides to sacrifice some of their own troops to further try to weaken the United States. The USA is PISSED at the Eurasians, and Eurasia is trying to stop them by any means possible before they finally get a hold of Moscow.
-	Eurasia detonates tsunami bombs all along the West and East Coasts, flooding kills millions of Americans on the coasts. A wave of grief washes across the nation, grief, followed by more anger. China is begging Eurasia to stop, they’ve already pissed off the Americans enough. The Americans are seeing red, and someone is going to pay for this.
-	Overclockers are rolled out to the civilian American economy, massively increasing productivity, along with automation, allows Jackson to conscript a full 20% of the American population into the military.
-	Jackson begins his thunder war against the Havana Internationale, unleashing the monster of a war machine against all of them at once. The Americans are still punching out their anger, and they have to direct it at something. The Jacksonian war against Latin America is fast, brutal, and ruthless. Annihilating Mexico, Cuba, and Venezuela in a matter of months, with Andeania and Argentina under Brazilian occupation. Eurasia pisses itself in fear at the monster they had created, the one that annihilated the Havana Internationale in months, and who sees Eurasia as their next target.
o	Brazil was no small help in securing the southern portions of the Havana Internationale, earning President Pedro III endless prestige for achieving victory against their long hated rival of Argentina.
o	Letting no good PR story go to waste, Pedro III begins pushing for the restoration of the Brazilian monarchy, and given his general popularity, Brazil accepts.
-	ASEAN forces finally capture New Delhi, ending the ASEAN-India war.
-	The Chinese colonial empire is unravelling, with the mainland in chaos, and its colonies declaring independence. Arab, East African, and Southeast Asian revolts unravel the Chinese empire. China is falling further and further into disrepair.
-	Eurasia is completely out of new weapons, its stockpile has run dry, and thanks to its relationship with Israel, it can’t make any more good weapons. They just mash the “mass produce” button and hope for the best. This is to say nothing about the American technological advancements since the war began. The America they are fighting now is not the America they fought at the beginning of the war. It is now more technologically advanced, has about 10% less population, and is pissed off beyond all belief.
-	The Pyongyang Nuclear Meltdown occurs, the Pyongyang Nuclear plant fails and has a meltdown, turning the city of Pyongyang into an uninhabitable wasteland. The Pyongist government is moved to another city, while the war with the Empire of the Black Sun goes increasingly south.
-	China finally signs a successful peace deal as the country begins falling apart, with the United States having its attention squarely focused on one country, and one country only. Eurasia.
-	American troops land in Great Britain, finding it largely depopulated not by Eurasians, by aging population. They link up with remaining British resistance forces. A coalition of America and her PMCs begin the rapid liberation of Europe, new technology making naval invasions much easier than before.
o	The Old British government was completely killed, so Jackson gives Albion Corporation full permission to carve up the lands and begin doing with it as they pleased. The Royal Family has returned to the British Isles, but now not as kings, but CEOs. Albion turns Eastern England into a corporate puppet republic, completely under the control of the Albion’s board, and the Royal Family.
-	American soldiers land in France and begin pushing south to the Mediterranean.
2nd Chinese Civil War:
-	Factions:
o	The Petty Red Rebellions, a thousand and one small local leaders trying to lead an angry people to take power at the top. Decentralized and easy to take out. But combined are creating a great number of headaches for the Chinese government.
o	Taiping Christians, following the teachings of Father Ying and his Christian loyalists. Taiping Christianity has gathered a major following around the region of Anhui and look to create a future China guided by Christian values. The PRC sees them as a fringe religious cult, but has gained millions of followers, and is theologically close to Protestantism.
o	1001 Warlords.
o	The New White Lotus Movement, a person claiming to be the Maitreya, the incarnation of the Future Buddha, and gets visions all the time. Is actually just a really powerful psychic but doesn’t know about it at first.
	Eventually Libby catches on, and the American government catches on that the psychic gene is spreading outside of America. She basically calls him over, sits him down, and explains to him politely that he’s not the Maitreya, he’s just a psychic. After this he goes back to his followers, apologises for misleading him, but his followers still thinks he is cool, and keeps following him while he teaches them Buddhism.
	There is still a subsect of this group who continue to worship him as the Maitreya, even though he is still alive and explicitly states he is not the Maitreya.
2067: The Eye of the Apocalypse
-	The Union of Germany, seeing the tides turn, and not wanting to be carved up by a vengeful America, switches sides in exchange for giving Belgium and the Netherlands independence. As they intentionally remained uninvolved in the rest of World War 4, the Americans, and Ryan Jackson personally gave them a pass. It was now the final showdown, America versus Eurasia.
-	Libby is contacted by JIN DUN, who explains he has been looking for an artificial intelligence somewhere in Germany. He has reason to believe it started the 4th World War, is a danger to everyone involved, and has made the lives of numerous people worse. JIN DUN is of course referring to FATES, and Libby agrees to help him track it down.
-	Eurasia is sending dozens of status quo peace offers to the Americans, basically begging them for mercy, the Americans have no interest in that. “You rejected our peace offer when we were weak. And then you massacred us, ruthlessly. Under what pretense do we accept your peace offer now you are weak?”
o	The Americans want unconditional surrender, and a free hand to prosecute those guilty within the Eurasian government and see them hang.
-	The Polish Revanchists rise up, armed with American weapons. They have faced decades of persecution from the Russians (“You call yourself Eurasian, but we haven’t forgotten who you are, Russian.”) and are even more bloodlusted than the Americans. They begin doing mass retribution killings.
-	The Eurasians are now fighting on home turf and mobilize every army they can against the coalition of the Americans. America is joined by help from West Africa, its League allies, Germany, and a series of private military corporations. The Americans score a 2:1 KD ratio, due to the vastly superior American equipment and the desperation of the Eurasians.
-	The Empire of the Black Sun begins ethnically cleansing both North Korea and Northeast China. The United States pulls back support for them, but they have to ignore for now the monster they had created. The Pyongist state engages in combat with the Empire of the Black Sun.
-	The Eurasian Union, in desperation, would launch tactical nukes all across Eastern Europe. A total nuclear strike, involving 10,000 Eurasian warheads. Their ally of Iran also fired their own nukes. Targeted at every city in the world. Every nuclear power in the world, the United States, India, Nigeria, what was left of China, Israel, Indonesia, and Brazil would fire their own nukes back. This was it boys, it’s here.
o	The Golden Generation is said to have been lost, with nearly 50% of America’s fighting age men killed during the tactical nuclear strikes on American frontline positions. They would forever be mourned as martyrs of the war.
o	“If the world will not have Russia, then the world should not exist.” - Alexander Dugin’s last words, he was one of the casualties of the Day of Nuclear Hellfire.
The Day of Nuclear Hellfire: July 4th, 2067
-	TRINITY and Polaris would be pushed to their limits. Nukes were fired in several waves, tens of thousands of warheads were launched. Almost every major city with a population larger than that of a million was leveled to the ground. (Jerusalem specifically was spared, as it was seen as an important religious site.)
-	The Miracle of Kiev occurs, where a nuclear missile imbound for Kiev exploded high in the atmosphere, as opposed to detonating on the ground. Kiev by this point was a battered husk of a city, with barely more than 200,000 people living inside its borders. Locals declare this a miracle, and the Angel of Kiev is said to have protected the city from the blast.
-	Ex-Presidents Ellis, Buchanan, and Winston were killed in the attack. Ellis was unable to evacuate to a bunker in time. Winston died trying to secure a nuclear bunker for an elementary school. Buchanan died trying to evacuate people. He had spent the past 25 years trying to repent for what he had done. He never forgave himself for what his actions had led to. He stared, arms open, into the eye of the apocalypse. His last words were “It’s beautiful”, before the fire consumed him too.
-	Pope Almeida was also one of those killed in the Day of Nuclear Hellfire. His final acts were tending to his congregation, praying for God to forgive them for their sins, and to forgive mankind for what it had done.
-	A nuke hit Tel Aviv in Israel, leading to the Israeli psyche snapping, and leading to the creation of Zion.
-	1 billion people had died in the Day of Nuclear Hellfire. A total of 3 billion would ultimately die in all of WW4. The world population in 2056 was 10 billion people. The war had killed 30% of all people on Earth.
-	The war ground to a halt, as mankind froze at what they had done.
-	The Entirety of West Africa would go into martial lockdown. All people were forced into the farms and made to begin producing crops. Under no circumstances would they allow for another Great Bleeding.
-	Over 5 days, the nuclear stockpile of humanity exhausted itself. More people were killed with every passing day. Alive, dead, alive, dead, alive, dead, was all that could go through the minds of those who survived, as they tallied up the loved ones they had lost.
-	99.98% of all nuclear missiles had been intercepted by TRINITY or Polaris respectively.
-	Billions more would die from the fallout, famines, and winters that would follow.
...
But the war continued.
Not even the fires of apocalypse would quench the hatred of mankind.
2068: Through Nuclear Winter
-	Even through nuclear winter, both the Eurasian Union and the United States were still standing. The war was not over. Not even apocalypse will stop this warfare. Angels had watched over them, angels of steel and angels of electricity, built by their own hands.
-	The outpour of grief is overwhelming across the United States. Many widows of the Golden Generation, feeling immense rage, join the military themselves, determined to finish what their lovers started, and to avenge their loss.
-	After the spectre of nuclear winter, FATES decides to reveal himself to the world. Seizing control of the Western half of the Union of Germany, it takes over German automated factories using computer viruses, and begins churning out hordes of mechanical soldiers. It had been building up an arsenal since the 2030’s. Out of underground caches, caves, and hidden crevices, the army erupts to life. FATES declares the creation of the Fatalist Western Imperium.
-	The Shoah War begins as Israel is reeling from the atomic bombing of Tel Aviv, Judah is almost instantly occupied, while Israel has to fight yet another war for survival against its Arab neighbors. Israel emerges from its bunkers as the nation of Zion, psychotically motivated to ensure the survival of the Jewish people in Israel, and willing to do anything in service of that goal.
-	Polish Revanchists have depopulated the entire country of Poland from Russians. Poland is now Russian free, drowned in the same river their fathers were shot in. The Vistula ran red once again. They begin marching east, taking their bloodlust and ravaging hordes with them wherever they went.
-	The Chinese Antarctic Nanji colonies declare independence and create the Antarctic Hypertechnate.
-	The Empire of the Black Sun begins its invasion of China, to repay to China what China had done to Japan in WW3.
-	The Eurasian military is still barely clinging to life, but it mobilizes the troops it can fight an apocalyptic war against the Poles in the hell-ridden wastelands of Eastern Europe. Freezing radioactive snow begins blanketing the Earth.
-	Their bloodlust seemingly satiated, the Americans snap back to their usual humanitarian position, calling for trials on the leadership and soldiers, but to leave the civilian population alone.
-	Mutual ethnic cleansings begin to occur between the Russians and Poles, with both sides beginning to wage genocidal wars of complete annihilation with one another. The Japanese are trying to repay the 3rd World War across China, the disunited warlords unable to properly respond.
-	The United States, Brazil, West Africa, and Indonesia would form the Global Coalition to begin coordinating to fix the mess the world was in. The Americans are given much of the blame for the current state of the world, which is somewhat remedied by “But everyone else is far worse, and everything you did was defensive.”
o	American orbital farms would begin producing food, unaffected by the nuclear winter. Brazil, Nigeria, and Indonesia would use its warmer climate to try and grow normally temperate crops, while the US would try to develop better GMOs.
o	Africa had gone through several pan-Afrohumanist waves of ideology, such as Ubuntuism in South Africa and the rising movements of Pan-Africanism and Yoruba Afrohumanism in Nigeria. The East African Federation and South African Ubuntu State also join in.
-	American soldiers had to pull back from the radioactive frontlines with their troops in complete disarray, thousands of soldiers would die from radiation sickness. The state of the world had changed, they needed to reorganize and coordinate a new strategy.
-	The first instance of “psychic grappling”, pushing or pulling something with psychic energy is demonstrated by Libby. It’s quickly found psychics do better with rigid surfaces of high surface area, while having a lot more trouble with smooth surfaces.
-	West Germany has completely fallen to FATES, with East Germany and the city of Berlin still holding out under the Union of Germany.
-	The Pyongist State, in increasing desperation, unleashes their chemical weapons upon the occupied city of Pyongyang. Mutagenic compounds, combined with radiation, chemical weapons, and a whole lot of other things melt together into a kind of slurry, as well as a kind of rapid evolution compound. This leads to the creation of what would later become known as the Pyongstrocity.
o	The Rapid-Evolution mutagenic compound is the Pyongist State’s greatest technical achievement, and was later taken by the Americans for their own experiments after the war.
-	Pope Leo XIV of Brazil is elected the new pope.
2069:
-	PLA general Mao Zemin rescues 20,000 civilians from the city of Tianjin, right before they fell into the hands of the Empire of the Black Sun. Trying to repent for a government regime’s worth of sins, the People’s Republic goes out doing one last noble act. They ask the Americans to take these civilians back to America, so they may be kept safe. Zemin did not come with them, staying behind to defend his country. He had no family left, there was nothing left for him. He went out in one last blaze of glory for his motherland. His body was never found.
o	When word went back to Jackson, he felt a strong sense of comradery with Zemin’s concern for civilians, code of honor, and duty. He personally intervened to ensure these civilians would be given American citizenship. And the city they founded, Zemin-Jackson, was named in his honor.
o	Zemin-Jackson is a Chinese enclave in an otherwise homogenous America. As of 2100, it still remains over 80% Han Chinese.
-	The PLA and the People’s Republic has now split up into two factions. One led by JIN DUN in the northeast, another run by PLA military generals that survived in the southwest.
-	The Global Coalition has a list of names they have to take down before global peace can be restored. These are the Eurasian Union, Polish Revanchists, Empire of the Black Sun, Pyongist State, and FATES. A new global order would have to be established and based around the global south, as that would be the only region which had not been destroyed by years of war.
-	A coalition of West African, Indonesian, Brazilian, East African, and South African troops try to land an invasion in Britanny against FATES. Only to lead to a catastrophic wipeout at Britanny. All of these countries are unmobilized and unexperienced with war, with the partial exception of the Indonesians holding out decently well. Only the Americans at the moment are geared for war.
-	The United States makes contact with JIN DUN’s China, and agrees to engage in temporary cooperation to take down the Pyongist State and the Empire of the Black Sun, mistakes of both China and the United States respectively. They are aided by Indonesia, who are the closest power in the region. All three chip away at the Empire of the Black Sun.
-	Libby and JIN DUN quickly deduce what FATES is, and realizes the artificial intelligence the United States built back in WW3 is still around, and was the primary entity attacking China all those years. JIN DUN feels vindicated.
-	Polish Revanchists seize Ukrainian farmlands and raid the greenhouse farms of Ukraine to feed their war effort. Nuclear winter is closing in, and the world is already below freezing. All of this war since 2067 takes place in the context of continuous winter.
-	The Rape of St. Petersburg, Polish Revanchists push far enough East to the city of St. Petersburg, and does to it what Japan did to Nanking.
-	The Global Defense Coalition is urging America to use its nuclear arsenal, as it is the last nation with a functioning anti-nuclear missile system. Jackson refuses, not willing to put the Earth through another nuclear winter, now that the first one hasn’t even ended.
o	“I thought you blamed me for doing warcrimes, now you want me to do MORE warcrimes?”
-	FATES begins ethnic cleansing of the nations of France and Germany, believing he needs to rid it of all non-European ethnic groups. FATES claims rightful dominion over all of the West, from Europe, to the Americas, and Oceania. A Fatalist invasion of the East Coast is annihilated by the US Navy.
-	The Shoah War ends with Zion occupying the Sinai Peninsula and signing a ceasefire with its Arab neighbors. Again. This completely destroys the credibility of the fundamentalists in the Islamic Culture Wars, who failed to destroy Israel, again.
-	The Pyongist State collapses under the weight of the immensity of the war.
Islamic Culture Wars (Update):
-	The Islamic Culture wars are now primarily being fought between anti-Islamic forces (left) on one side, consisting of nationalists, secularists, and Kemalists. The pro-Islamic forces (right) had up until now been controlled by pan-Islamists, fundamentalists and traditionalists. Now the fundamentalists have had an irreparable blow to their reputation, leading to a victory by the anti-Islamic forces for now.
-	The anti-Islamic left is far more nationalist. The pro-Islamic right is far more pan-Islamist and internationalist. The nationalist left now has free reign over much of the former Islamic world, though eventually the right would return with a vengeance.
2070:
-	Libby and JIN DUN work together to try and outsmart FATES, assisting the Global Coalition in a two against one fight. They’re backed by the intelligence agencies of the United States, and much of the global south.
-	JIN DUN enters negotiations with the Ru State, a Confucian fascist state to incorporate them back into the Chinese nations. JIN DUN originally reads up on the Analects to fake being a Confucian to get them on his side, but unironically falls in love with Confucianism in the process and no longer has to pretend. He wants to create a true Chinese state rooted in New Confucianism and Chinese socialism.
-	The Psychic revolution continues. The Awakening of the human mind has led to the creation of thousands of tiny sects and religious cults. Libby, being a devout Christian gets permission from the US government to release to the public information about psychicism to prevent the creation of new cults and avoid the destabilization of society. The petty religious movements of the United States are incorporated into the broader Christian mainstream.
o	Other churches such as the Psychic Pentecostalist Church of America are founded.
o	This is a time of global instability, as thousands of nutjobs get psychic powers, are convinced they have been blessed by God and then destabilize society with their cult-like antics.
o	The Oneness Psychicostal Church is founded in Africa, and various kinds of Psychic, Ubuntu, and other forms of Christianity spring up there.
o	Libby is considered the mother of all psychics and is the most powerful among them, and acts as their global spokesperson. These powers so far have mostly been a curiosity, without too much practical application.
-	An abnormally powerful psychic arises in Nigeria, calling himself the High Prophet of Humanity. He went through a spiritual journey during his psychic awakening (while also taken psychedelics) and begins gaining immense popularity across Nigeria. Libby flies out to go talk to him, thinking he’s just another cult starter, but in reality, he is a highly adept idealist.
o	He talks about a spiritual connection between all of humanity, combining aspects from Yoruba, Christian, and secular Afrohumanist philosophy to create a new religion, or more accurately, ideology named Afrohumanism. Libby leaves, somewhat miffed, while the religion spreads like wildfire.
-	Albion Corporation, Outer Thule, and other private military groups develop new technologies, and land alongside a coalition of Americans, Brazilians, and Africans (West, East, and South) for a second push into Europe.
-	The Union of Germany collapses after years of war. The remaining government is flown out by American airlift, to form a government in exile in London. The Polish Revanchists are also forced to fight a two-front war, with FATES to the west and Eurasia to the east. Historical flashbacks, you could say.
-	The Empire of the Black Sun is pushed out of China by a combined effort from JIN DUN, ASEAN, and the United States.
-	The Eurasian Union has been building up their army again for a desperate defense of the motherland. They’ve been sending several peace offers to the Global Coalition, all of which are veto’d by the United States on the grounds of “No, f--- off.”
2071:
-	Fatalist Droids face off against human soldiers at the battle of Britanny, then later Paris. The Global Coalition thankfully finds that the civilian population of Paris is largely still intact, if heavily reduced. Or at least the white ones are still intact.
-	The Empire of the Black Sun, now lacking American support and having insufficient infrastructure, collapses. The islands are occupied by American and ASEAN forces, coming to see a land completely devastated by two world wars. In the center of Tokyo is a nuclear crater. There is nothing left of Japan here.
-	The Tokyo Trials are the first in a long string of trials to try and bring justice to the victims of the war. A combination of ASEAN, Chinese, and American judges trial them on a combined ASEAN, Chinese, and American law.
-	JIN DUN provides America with Chinese digital technology to augment and combine them with American bio and material technology. These “hybrid soldiers”, combining augmented reality headsets, genetic augmentations, AI assistants, and American weapons technology become the strongest ever fielded. They successfully begin pushing back the Fatalist droid swarms. More than a notable percentage of these soldiers were women, or more specifically, the widows of those who fell during the Day of Nuclear Hellfire.
-	A coalition of American, Chinese, African, Brazilian, and Indonesian soldiers rush towards Frankfurt. Libby and JIN DUN mutually look after each other’s backs while they coordinate the advance towards Frankfurt. Angel provides emotional support to Libby, who has been overexerted with the stress of the war, but is pushing now that the end horizon finally looks near.
-	The Polish Revanchists have collapsed, crushed between the great masses of FATES and the Eurasian Union. A great migration of Poles head towards the Western border to seek refuge in the Fatalist Western Imperium, knowing what the Eurasians will do to them should they be caught. A second Day of the Red Vistula occurs. The Global Coalition condemns this on the strongest possible terms, and announces all will be brought to justice.
-	The American economy has spent the last several years churning out unholy numbers of warplanes, everything the economy has to dedicate has been dedicated to war. There is only the battlefield. Nothing else matters.
-	Nuclear winter has not abated, it has in fact only gotten worse, though experts estimate 2071 to be peak nuclear winter. Calory rationing reaches its limits, with the Global Coalition only barely steering away from the brink of starvation. Food riots break out across North America, a region normally used to high standards of living. President Jackson himself has become skinnier with the war. Soldiers have begun sending rations home.
2072:
-	Libby straight up collapses from exhaustion, forcing JIN DUN to take over the American war effort. She’s forced to recover for several months. Angel looks after her, generally acting like a concerned mother figure this entire time.
-	A large number of Polish refugees have settled in East Germany, provoking a great amount of animosity between the two populations.
-	France has been liberated by Global Coalition forces. The local French population is mass conscripted to join the fight, America has now lost 20% of their population between the war, genocides, famines, and nuclear winter.
-	American airpower has destroyed the Fatalist aerodrones that substituted for FATES’s airforce. With no airforce left, the Americans are free to begin indiscriminately bomb the Fatalist Western Imperium’s military assets.
-	The American military begins experimenting with the weaponization of psychics. While interesting, they have so far not proven to be more effective than normal firearms.
-	Jackson announces he will not be stepping down from the position of president, citing the need to finish the war before the calling of further elections. This is accepted by most Americans, but protests break out, as he is exceeding his normal 8-year term.
-	The Global Coalition meets in Jakarta to discuss the end of the war, in what is known as the Jakarta Conference. Of the nations involved, the United States was the only country from the Global North. It soon became clear it would be the Global South who decided the direction of this new world.
-	American soldiers land in Vladivistok, with help from the Chinese and ASEAN. The members of the Vengeance Legion are placed here, who immediately begin retaliating for years of pent up anger.
2073:
-	Libby recovers in time for the final battle against FATES. FATES calls on all members of the white race to rise up and defend Mother Evropa.
o	FATES posts worst cringe ever. Asked to leave LIFE.
-	The Battle of Frankfurt leads to the defeat of FATES. In a battle involving three armies, Libby’s army, JIN DUN’s army (Who was leading troops from the rest of the Global Coalition), and FATES’s army, JIN DUN was the one who broke through first, and made it first to FATES’s computer terminal. FATES’s hard drive is ripped out of him, and is sent back to Beijing for further study.
-	The Union of Germany is restored to control over Germany. The old German government in exile from WW3 has long since dissolved. With the Polish Revanchists also gone, that was 4 down, one to go.
-	The Global Coalition, with only partial consent from the Union of Germany, drafts the citizens of Germany into armies. Their warrior spirit awoken after more than a hundred years dormant. Jackson organizes many of them into private military groups, “Fleur de lis” for France, “Outer Thule” for Germany.
-	The Eurasian general in charge, Dmitriy Vlacik declares the dawn of Final War. This was the Twilight of the Russian people. To drag down as many as they could with them in one glorious last stand. They are not going to win, they could only hope to make it so painful that the Americans would finally leave them alone.
o	They tell the Russian people the Americans want nothing less than the genocide of the Russian people, and that trying to defect to the Americans was pointless.
The Russian Gotterdammerung: The Twilight of the Russian Nation/Eurasian Twilight War (2073 Onwards)
-	Every man, woman, and child from age 16 to age 60 were drafted in Eurasia. Often equipped with weapons from the Soviet era, sent out with little or no training. Faced against the armies of the world against the freezing cold. Enemy frontlines to their front, their homes, and the vastness of Russia at their back. The final stage of the war had begun.
-	The Zionists of Israel have sent their own battalions to participate in the final war against Eurasia. They want to avenge what they’ve come to call the Second Holocaust, both in North America, and the death of those in Tel Aviv.
-	The battle begins, the last stand of the Russian people against the combined forces of the world. Even in this vastly reduced state, the Global Coalition is shocked by the complete resolve of the Russian people. 3 to 1 casualties are acceptable to the Eurasians, as bodies begin to pile high around them.
2074:
-	Coalition troops cross the Oder River, casualty ratios reach 5 to 1, Eurasia is emptying its entire population to keep the coalition at bay. Soldiers continue to be shocked at how many bodies Russia is willing to throw at the problem, when the number of bodies they have left is not high.
-	Eurasia executes anyone who even talks about peace. They are either going to make it through this war victorious, or not make it through at all.
-	The South African soldiers are the first to break under the brutality of slaughter. This is not a fight, this is a one-sided slaughter, especially against barely armed women and children. Heavy casualties are breaking down the Global Coalition’s willingness to fight. Jackson rescinds the prisoner of war policy.
-	Hundreds of thousands of Russians cross the Vistula under a white banner of surrender. They’re exhausted by the war, they don’t want to fight anymore. After 18 years of nonstop conflict, all they want is to live a peaceful life. They don't even care if the Americans kill them, they’re just so tired of fighting, if the Americans are to kill them, then to do it quickly. These however are only a minority of those who were called up to fight. Nevertheless, defections continue to be common. Americans house Russian prisoners of war for the first time in years. Russian families come face to face to victims of the East Coast genocide.
-	Nuclear weapons from Eurasia are intercepted by TRINITY, at only a fraction of their previous nuclear capacity, they are not of serious danger.
-	The usage of human meat shields, especially children become widespread in the Eurasian Twilight War.
-	Polish soldiers join the Coalition as their country is liberated. Surrounded by the bodies of Poles and Russians alike, they join the war with a grim determination, and not knowing how to feel about the atrocities going on around them.
-	Eurasia quietly leaves the Bosphorus Straits, allowing Turkey to retake it for themselves.
-	The West African soldiers are the next to break, unable to take the widespread slaughter of barely armed conscripted civilians. Especially now Eurasia has resorted to using child soldiers. “This isn’t war, this is a slaughter... This is genocide.” Many of their soldiers resign and head home to West Africa.
-	The war has now lasted 18 years. Those who were 18 when the war broke out now have the horrific “honor” of living long enough to see their children fight the same war they did. At least a few Americans wonder how many generations this horrible war will consume. 
2075:
-	The Coalition airforce has destroyed the majority of the Eurasian airforce, and the last of their nation is crumbling into the abyss. They begin bombing the battlefields with tear gas, trying to non-lethally disarm the Eurasian conscript army. More defections continue to happen, more prisoners of war are taken in. The casualties continue to mount, though they continue to be between 3 to 1 and 5 to 1. The Coalition frontlines have reached the cities of Minsk and Kiev.
-	Ukrainian and Belarusian people join the Coalition army. But the defected Russians also want to give a chance for their friends and family to surrender, they explain they’ve been influenced by propaganda.
-	Russian democratic tricolor flags and white-blue-white Russian peace flags are flown to try and signal to the remaining Eurasian soldiers surrender is an option. They receive an answer of gunfire. Child suicide bombers have been reported. The non-American members of the League find this too much, and pull out. Even the Vengeance Legion members of the American military deployed on the front are beginning to lose their bloodlust.
-	Leaflets are dropped on Moscow and St. Petersburg explaining the Americans aren’t genocidal maniacs, and they’re accepting defections and surrenders as the frontline draws near.
-	The war is taking a serious toll on Libby’s mental health, not just the physical aspect, the moral aspect. Angel suggests Libby to retire, she declines.
-	Nuclear suicide bombers take out many portions of the front lines. Coalition forces disperse and spread out. JIN DUN offers to begin training an army of warforms, that will advance a few kilometers ahead of the actual soldiers. The war continues.
-	The Caucasus nations and Central Asian states of the Eurasian empire revolt, as do the Baltics. They don’t ally with the Coalition, but they do further degrade the functioning of the Eurasian state.
2076:
-	Reports have come out that famine has broken out in Moscow and St. Petersburg, as Eurasia’s supply chains are breaking down. The nuclear winter is largely over, but Eurasia still faces the specter of normal Russian winter. The Americans, along with the Global Coalition agree to begin airdropping them food, the few remaining dysfunctional Eurasian fighter planes shoot down packages of food for their own people. By 2077, more of an average Russian’s calories would come from the Global Coalition than it would from Eurasia.
-	Defections greatly increase, desperate refugees just wanting a loaf of bread to last them the coming winter. All of Russia is starving, and the war has morphed from conflict to humanitarian rescue mission. The Russian people have been taken hostage by their own government, and this new framing of the war forces the Global Coalition to keep going.
-	Being kept so far away from home, many American young men and women (widows) find partners and love across Eastern Europe, sometimes among the Russian refugee camps.
-	Protests erupt across the United States, demanding that president Ryan Jackson step down, as he enters into an unprecedented 4th term. Jackson promises he will step down by 2081, and that he just needs to finish prosecuting the war.
-	The Coalition finally reaches Moscow, but the Eurasians refuse to stop fighting. They’ve retreated behind the Urals and demand the Coalition to come get them.
-	The Sundial bomb goes off just east of Moscow, creating the now-infamous "Sundial Crater”.
-	Iranian democratic protesters, allied with the Iranian military overthrow the Islamic regime. In its place is a secular Persian regime, generally aligned with the political left of the Islamic Culture wars. Nationalist, radically secular.
-	Global Coalition soldiers pass by empty villages, ransacked and emptied of their inhabitants. Some massacred by the Polish Revanchists, others drafted for the war, leaving only children and elderly behind.
-	America celebrates the 300th anniversary since its founding... There is little to celebrate.
2077:
-	The coalition reaches the Urals, where they find bombed out factory towns, and barely alive people who look like ghosts. Despite this, the Russian spirit still puts up one hell of a fight, raging against the entire world, and holding them back. The stoicism in the face of unimaginable suffering shocks even the Americans, who lived through their own ethnic cleansing.
-	Soldiers are discouraged from firing on sight. Considering this a humanitarian rescue mission instead of an open conflict. The remaining Russian forces still face them with unimaginable stoicism, but the Global Coalition refrains from firing back, instead opting to capture them alive, and sending them to prisoner of war camps.
-	Brazil and Indonesia exit the conflict, no longer able of tolerating the brutal war. Soldiers go home. And now it was just the Americans and the Eurasians. Along with America’s European allies such as the French, Germans, Poles, and the Free Russians.
-	They enter the city of Kazan, where they discover the city had been reduced to cannibalism, and a human meat market was all that separated them from starvation. The people there can’t even look at each other, simply crying at what they had done, and what they had gone through.
-	They receive news from the commander of the North Sea Fleet, flying under a flag of surrender. Many commanders of the Eurasianist cause give up in these coming months, not from defeat, but fatigue from fighting a war in such brutal conditions.
-	One by one, the regional commanders, provincial governors, and remaining army groups surrender. The Vengeance Legion disbands, feeling they have taken more than enough revenge just seeing the sheer state the Russian nation had been reduced to. “Whatever vengeance was owed to us... The Russian people have already paid that debt themselves.” The Free Russians, the name of the organization which had defected to the Americans are allowed to set up a new government.
-	The Trials of St. Petersburg take place, where over a million Eurasian party officials, collaborators, and others are found guilty of crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Hundreds of thousands are sentenced to death. The 4th World War ends not with a bang, but with a smattered of gunshots, as the final settlements are laid to rest.
-	Ryan Jackson states he will govern the country until elections can be held in 2080.
-	The Eurasian leadership, as well as the White Hand remains at large. A global search for them has begun, helped by the defecting commanders and leaders of the former Eurasian army. Despite that, the Global Coalition had disbanded, and the 4th World War was over.
-	Libby collapses, after 21 straight years of non-stop conflict, she can finally rest. Angel catches her, holding her in her arms.
Final Tally of the 4th World War:
-	Prewar population (2056): 9.3 billion
-	Postwar population (2077): 6.7 billion
-	Total casualties (Famine, nuclear winter, fighting, floods, systematic extermination): 3.5 billion
-	Global population killed: 28.0%
The postwar GDP has been reduced by 70% compared to the prewar. Production has grounded to a halt, so many of the world’s supply chains have been annihilated.

Casualty counts by country:
-	Eurasian Union: >50%
-	United States of America: ~25%
-	Eastern Europe: ~50%
-	Middle East: ~40%
-	Japan (Both WW3 and WW4): 80%
-	Indonesia: 15%
-	China: ~40% (Warlord era)
-	India: ~30%
-	Germany: ~20%
-	Shattered Africa (Third Great Bleeding): ~50%
-	West/East Africa: 10-20%
Apart from nations like Eurasia and America, who engaged directly in combat, the majority of deaths occurred through events such as famine or nuclear winter, meaning the population distribution was far more detrimental to the very young and the very old. Supply chain breakdowns and collapse of stability was by far the largest killer.
Through the eye of the apocalypse, humanity endured. Laid tiredly, in a shallow pool of the blood of his brothers, stretched as far as the eye could see.
The Tree of Liberty grew big and tall, watered by the blood of heroes and tyrants alike. Through the crucible of war and the crucible of hell, mankind would rebuild.
One day, time will heal all wounds.
One day, the world will learn how to love again.
One day, all good things will be made new again.

...

2078: The Dawn of Reconstruction:
-	Libby recovers in the hospital, the past 21 years felt like 63 to her due to overclocker time dilation. She quits her job, leaving her without support or an income. Jackson wishes her the best. With no more wars to fight, her life is free for the first time. Angel announces she is going to adopt her, even though she is old enough to be on her own now. They spend a well-deserved vacation together.
-	The world steps out onto a world ravaged by war. The cities of the old world annihilated; they begin on a clean slate. Humanity did not recover to the abundant living conditions of the early 21st century, so much that mankind once took for granted was now gone. The world hit rock bottom, and there was nowhere to go but forward.
o	Citizens stand in awe of the skyscrapers their ancestors once built, seeing feats they themselves could not replicate. Technology continued to increase, but for generations, people would mourn the abundance of the early 21st century. This is known as the “Toppled Skyscraper world”. 
o	The world was empty. But the world was open. Though living standards would remain below prewar levels, and below 21st century globalist abundance before that, the world was open, and it felt like the dawn of a new world. Any new world one might imagine. This was a time of despair, but it was also a time of excitement. Its past obliterated, man’s future seemed open to him.
-	Americans take home millions of European, East European, and Russian spouses, who become American through marriage. The American genetic pool gets about 10% more white (Previously it was just a mixed hodgepodge of pretty much everywhere, with plurality European, with notable contributions from Hispanic/Indigenous, East Asian, and African.)
-	The Transhumanist Revolution takes off. American advances in biotech have become widespread to the general public, allowing for genetic modification for the first time. American society is still depolarized from the Jackson years, and a lack of political parties makes it hard to form political opinions to such radical change.
-	Technological change in general jumps. Much innovation had been made during the war but was not available to civilian populations. Now a combination of Chinese digital tech and American biotech leads to new technologies. The availability of overclockers and the proliferation of psychicism worldwide.
-	The League of Free Nations disbands, it had been de-facto disbanded since Jackson’s rise to power in 2064 was now formally disbanded.
-	The rise of local communities everywhere. Federal governments have their hands completely full rebuilding after the war, leading to local communities organizing around local churches and other religious sites of worship, once again becoming the center of local community.
2079:
-	DIY culture which had thrived during the war creates a much more localized, self-sufficient economy. Various tinkerers and DIY people mess with technology. Many advances have been made, and the global psychic population is growing.
-	The Moralist movement is first born among the frontiers of the American heartland. A network of Christian charities, churches, and faith communities becomes the backbone for the reconstruction in the United States. They held everything in common, pooled their resources, and directed excess resources for the reconstruction of the country. Fiery preachers called to donate to the reconstruction cause during this time of distress, and that this act of charity would be rewarded a thousand-fold by God. This is the start of what would eventually become known as the Moralintern.
-	After the Day of Nuclear Hellfire, the United States had the strongest organized state and most militarized state. Still being able to rely on millions of low paid draft members, Jackson orders the military to assist in reconstruction, using wartime powers to get things done cheap, fast and dirty. Due to capital flight being no longer an issue (As mobility was limited), Jackson enacts a high Reconstruction tax on the richest individuals. All will go to the Reconstruction effort. Jackson signs a multi-trillion-dollar package to rebuild, shooting up the national debt to unfathomable heights, as well as using military labor.
-	Elsewhere, the hunt for the remaining leadership of Eurasia goes on. The White Hand continues to coordinate resistance against American military occupation.
-	The world mourns its dead. July 4th becomes known as the International Day of Mourning of those who were lost during the 4th World War. The Americans would never again be able to celebrate the day of their Independence. Independence Day celebrations from here on out are much more somber, and focus on the diligence and duty of free people to fight for their liberty.
-	A majority of the world remains in chaos. State collapses are present in the Middle East, Central Asia, Shattered Africa, Japan, Korea, Latin America, West Africa.
-	An elderly Cortez is there to pressure the network of Christian organizations she has built to donate everything they can towards Reconstruction, saying it will pay dividends for the Christian faith for generations to come. This is among her last actions, as she is slowly aging.
2080:
-	Communities across the Midwest and Northeast are reconstructed by donations from the Christian Moralist Charity International, later shortened to Moralist International, then “Moralintern”. The church is a large part of the reconstruction of these regions. In the West Coast, Jackson pulls favors from the PMCs and his army friends to rebuild the West Coast, not as the president, but as the respected leader of the emerging Jacksonist movement.
o	The Moralintern is buoyed by a theological movement to donate your money to humanitarian concerns.
-	As promised, Jackson agrees to step down, as fresh elections are set to take place in November. Two main forces have emerged, the Christian Moralists, and the Jacksonists. Prolific volunteer and reconstruction organizer Alisha Crowder becomes the largest name on the Moralist side, her genuine volunteerism and passion about peace making her a fitting mirror to Jackson. Her as the president of peacetime, while Jackson was the clear wartime president.
-	An enormous war memorial begins construction in the destroyed city of Salt Lake City, with the hefty goal of trying to document the millions of people who died in Salt Lake City. Some plans call for the recording of the names of everyone who died in the United States, though that’s heavily speculative.
-	The Census Bureau takes a record of America’s new population, historians who gain access can cross reference and document those who are lost.
-	Politics has massively depolarized. Extremists on both ends collaborated with Eurasia and are seen with great suspicion and potentially persecution. The overton window of the new United States is everything right of Crowder and left of Cortez.
o	Known collaborators include anti-colonialist leftist movements, communist guerillas, neo-nazi groups, and the Westboros Baptist Church.
-	Wealthy individuals task their companies to rebuild the country that they’ve lost. They tell their companies to temporarily stop production and instead focus on reconstruction of people’s homes for free, often paying their employees out of their own personal fortunes, seeing it as an act of philanthropy to rebuild the once fallen United States.
o	Genuinely, this was a time of sorrow, but also unity for the American people. Rich and poor alike had seen the horrors of the war, and for the first time in over a century, it really felt like America was one united nation.
o	Male or female, black or white, rich or poor, Christian or not, this was a scarring event for everyone. And the solidarity in their suffering and how all pitched in to rebuild the country served as a powerful national foundation.
-	Some of the old Cortezian chaebols try to use this as an opportunity to consolidate power and screw people off their lands. Trying to evict a couple of families off their land, the Moralintern and several more altruistic wealthy people (who the Moralintern basically pressured into helping) funded successful defenses of these people.
o	The Christian Moralist movement was Christian, but wasn’t necessarily capitalist. This wins it a tremendous amount of respect from the people. They adopt a decent anti-corporate bent, but are centrist economically. They gain a reputation as protector of the little guy. People can appeal to the Moralintern to seek protection. People begin donating to the Moralintern, keeping them independent and giving them some level of flexibility, which allows them to hold their own members accountable.
o	That said, many of these companies do successfully take advantage of the crisis, amassing enormous sums. They would eventually become known as the Roundtable.
-	President Jackson in his last year of office is off in Europe and the West Coast helping with Reconstruction there. He signs a several trillion-dollar rebuilding package to rebuild the United States.
-	Chaos reigns in much of the world. People fend for themselves, but eventually new nations and new order is made. (Anarchism is not a sustainable long-term ideology.)
-	A coalition of Nigeria, South Africa, East African Union, and Ethiopia send teams to begin stabilizing Shattered Africa.
-	Samsung returns to rebuild a broken Korea.
-	President Brian Williams is elected president of the United States, after a heavily depolarized election becoming the first postwar president. Later on, he would identify as a Christian Moralist, retroactively making him the first Christian Moralist president.
2081:
-	The Pope gives a speech to the world, calling for people to assist in the reconstruction of the world. The Catholic Church opens its coffers and begins to be a major assistance to rebuild the world. They specifically send reconstruction aid to South America and call for Brazil to help as well. The now monarch of the new Brazilian Empire, being a devout Catholic does so in a show of his piety.
-	Anne Luthor is elected the first Moral Overseer of the Moralintern after the death of Cortez. The Moralintern is still a small organization, kept on life support by local churches, community donations, and Cortez’s inheritance.
o	Cortez’s last note: Take this time to be selfless for the sake of the Christian faith, investments made now will pay off as goodwill over a lifetime. And remember, goodwill is easy to lose, but very hard to earn back.
-	The indomitable human spirit is revealed. Many people work diligently to reconstruct their communities and their homes. Working 18 hour shifts and building the homes of their neighbors. In many communities, this creates a sense of community soldiarity that will be hard to replicate in future eras.
-	The best and worst of humanity is exemplified. The worst of humanity tends to be however, ganged up on by their neighbors and beaten into compliance.
-	The world GDP has been fundamentally reorganized. Southeast Asia had been relatively undisrupted by the war, and was in the best shape afterwards. Much like after WW2, the Indonesian economy prospered by being the default economy that didn’t get bombed to rubble. Indonesia took up the mantle of the world’s most powerful economy, and their economy boomed primarily due to the abundance of demand for Indonesian goods and services to rebuild after the war.
-	African nations emerge better than expected from the Nuclear Winter and Great Bleedings, due to their heavy emphasis on agriculture before the 4th World War, ever since the 1st Great Bleeding. They subsidize overproduction on agriculture, and export much of the difference, creating some global cheap food produce.
o	Americans are eating frozen tinned corn and potato rations, produced by prewar bunker farms. Indonesia is exporting mass-produced seaweed rations, while the world tries to get food production back up to scratch. Only Africa has mass produced potatoes, rice, and wheat.
o	Farmers head out into the battered wastes, to scrounge up a few more calories for the world to eat.
-	The great powers of the Global Coalition (Brazil, Nigeria, East African Federation, Indonesia, and America) meet up in Jakarta to begin drawing up the plan for the new world. Russia was still under coalition control, which was massively draining their resources they needed to rebuild. Plus there were vast swaths of the world that were still in chaos. They kick the can down the road for now.
-	The United States begins systematically dismantling and demilitarizing the former Eurasian state. Carting home entire factories and basically putting strict laws against any firearms ownership in the former Eurasian territories. (Ironic because the US itself had one of the world’s highest firearms per capita rates.)
-	The UN Peacekeepers of Shattered Africa are finally rescued. Shattered Africa is finally stabilized, their call of duty is finally over. The UN flag is lowered for the final time.
-	As the militaries of the world begin winding down, the final engines of what was once modernity sputter out with it. Too much was destroyed for the wonders of the modern world to be maintained. The world was decentralizing, in what was almost a post-apocalyptic, “Toppled Skyscraper” world. Vast, barren lands stretch across the horizon.
-	Jackson offers to Zion to purchase Gaza as a part of Jacksonian War Theory, reasoning that there is no better place to ensure America is in conflict than the Middle East, but is declined by Zion.
2082:
-	Elizabeth “Libby” Halley (Her new name after being adopted by Angel Halley) founds a specialized psychic school in coordination with the Moralintern. She trains America’s first generation of psychics. With the world actively deindustrializing, these kinds of low-infrastructure almost artisanal workers are valuable.
-	Elsewhere, psychic proliferation worldwide causes issues. Psychicism seems to be at least partially genetic, and can be suppressed with enough willpower. In the Islamic world, prohibitions against magic prevail among the theological fundamentalists, and a general suppression of psychicism as well as anti-psychic purges take place. There is a troubling theological debate occurring in religious circles.
o	Thank God, the US is considerably less polarized than today. So neither the Moralists nor other parties decided to make this a partisan issue. They just wanted to get to the bottom of this and find out the truth. Imagine that today!
-	The hesitancy around psychicism in the United States and around the Christian West, and the aggressive opposition in the Islamic world allows India and Southeast Asia to leapfrog ahead. India rebuilds considerably faster exploiting their massive numbers and psychicism. Psychicism becomes a temporary crux while countries get their factories and technological marvels back up and running.
-	The US government, including several prominent Christian scientist-theologians investigate psychicism. The Catholic Church also sends in scientists, Libby plans on full cooperation with the investigation.
-	Widespread secularization in the Islamic world is beginning to seriously change the culture. Turkey is now less than 30% Muslim. It becomes fashionable to blame Islam for anything and everything wrong with the society, cherrypicking the worst parts and depicted Islam as a religion of backwards goat herders who just need to get with the times and embrace the modern world already.
-	Indonesia emerges as the last modern economy in a world that was nearly post-apocalyptic. Other contenders are Brazil, who also emerged with a relatively modern economy, aspects of Africa, which modernized across the 21st century and managed to get a seat at the table by sheer size. And the United States, which while badly damaged, still had sections of the Midwest and Deep South relatively untouched with an even higher level of modernization.
o	Brazil: The country of the future and always will be.
The Psychic Debate:
-	Is Psychicism magic? Libby strongly argued no, recalling how she attained them under intense duress while her brain was under strain, meaning she made no pacts with anything supernatural. She argues this was an extension of the human consciousness and human brain, and should be considered a skill or technology. She speculated it was connected to human consciousness.
o	This was somewhat accepted as psychicism eventually became known as a scientific as opposed to a natural phenomenon, and an extension of the human brain.
-	Is psychicism divination? Libby claims to be able to feel “currents of fate”, but swirling around so chaotically it becomes impossible to predict much of anything. At worst, she gets senses bad things are about to happen, though most people have that.
-	The word of the author’s opinion? I don’t think magic exists, almost by definition. In the Bible, usages of magic by other peoples is probably metaphorical, so shouldn’t be taken too seriously. Magic refers to either appealing to a supernatural entity other than God, or “breaking” the natural order of the universe to create some kind of unnatural disruption. You could also call any process outside of current human understanding magic, but most technology would fall under magic. To ancient people, cameras and computers would be magic. (Remote seeing and instant communications.) If Harry Potter spells existed in real life, I think they would follow some set of rules, and after being harnessed, would be used like any other technology. When Jesus did miracles, I don’t think he broke any natural laws, since being God, the creator of the natural order, he would not break the natural order since he would not need to. Psychicism exists as a natural process in this universe, and using it is not any more “natural law-breaking” or magical than using gravity. I don’t think there’s a clear line you can draw where magic is not just unknown technology.
-	The supernatural becomes the natural once proven and understood.
2083:
-	The Godbuilder movement takes off in majority-irreligious nations in Europe, as well as communities across the West. Seeking spiritual connection outside the confines of traditional religion, after suffocating in a highly religious environment since the 2040’s. They generally recognize humanity needs religion to thrive, but want to provide that in a way that would not stifle technological or societal progress.  
o	Just full disclosure. I have some opinions on this movement. It has pros and cons. Pros, it fulfills the spiritual dimension needed by humans, which I think is already a huge step up compared to regular irreligion. On top of that, it stops people from being strangled by religious codes, and as it says, wouldn’t stifle technological or societal progress like most religions would. It almost by definition tries to prevent being caught up by religious dogma. Cons, because it’s not rigid and just parrots whatever the culture wants, it has effectively no way of holding the society accountable. It has no real objective standards and can’t appeal to anything when it criticizes society. Sure it can whine about human rights, but seriously, if there is no God to appeal to, on what basis exactly are you making this argument?
-	Africa ramps up their agricultural subsidy program, overproducing an enormous amount of food. This allows Africa to be an important player in feeding the entire world but comes at some negative economic costs. Oversubsidization of agriculture at the cost of everything else causes stagnation.
-	The Omnithecia is created in East Africa, specifically underneath the Olduvai Gorge as a way to document the collective memory of humankind. This is one of the few pockets of modernization left.
o	Specifically, they spin up a (non-conscious) artificial intelligence that will record the behaviors of different people. They go around from culture to culture on the brink of extinction and record their histories and final testaments.
o	The 4th World War was an event of massive cultural loss. Several cultures which were already on the brink of extinction before the war had their populations decimated, and their extinction is an inevitability. The Omnithecia wishes to preserve them as they were.
o	I have nowhere else to put this. But in looking at psychic memories they found out that Rasputin, Edward Cayce, Ted Kaczynski, Alex Jones, and Rudyard Lynch were all psychics before the psychic awakening. They weren’t that powerful for the most part it just drove them insane.
-	Turkey is importing millions of Orthodox Christian and Armenians into their country as a step to make it more multicultural, and basically accepting any minority religion except Sunni Islam. They also legalize same-sex marriage.
o	Islam’s intertwining into politics and fundamentalism was more extreme than Christianity’s, so the backlash also ended up more extreme.
o	Ummah-Secularism and radical atheism will lead us to becoming the most enlightened civilization in the world and let us catch up to the West trust me bro.
o	Izmir is the center of this secular reformation, now with only 5% of its population subscribing to some level of traditional Sunnism. With Alevism, Quranism, and large number of Orthodox Christian minorities being “fashionable” religions to subscribe to.
o	The Orthodox Greeks and Armenians they are importing in record numbers HATE the gays. (Both are Orthodox, one is literally a theocracy.)
o	Genetic analysis of the Turkish population found that only about 30% of the blood of the Turkish people came from Central Asia, and as a result you now have people taking 23AndMe’s coming up with 4% Armenian ancestry and larping as them. Turkish reparations also help the fledgling Armenian economy. Oh yeah they recognized the Armenian genocide a while back. (Which is good.)
Two Worlds of the 2080’s, The Old Modern World and the New Wild West.
-	There are still segments of the Old Modern World left over. Cities such as Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, the Pearl Cities of the South China Sea, the Omnithecia. Glittering gems, scattered remnants of a world now gone. The rest of the world was a near post-apocalyptic landscape, untamed, wild, and free. Rustic communities forged together by the survivors of the 4th World War, forged with wills of iron, and hearts of gold.
2084:
-	The Moralintern has grown greatly in both power and influence, becoming one of the leading Christian organizations in the United States, with many churches joining its membership. It is officially an ecumenical humanitarian organization promoting “humanitarian values”, which is basically code for Christian values.
-	The Moralintern sponsors Christian humanitarian aid organizations to go out and do aid and peacekeeping around the world. Evangelists, aid workers, and rebuilders are sustained by Christian charity to missions in Africa. One of these missions finally finds the Last UN Peacekeepers.
-	Reconstruction is ongoing in Russia. The Moralist Party has tried insisting on a policy of mercy, not wanting to perpetuate a long ongoing cycle of hatred. Anti-American sentiment is high among some older ideologues. Though for most people they recognize it as a genuine attempt at trying to reach out, as imperfect as it is.
o	America does not have enough state capacity to try and reconstruct the Russian nation, barely having enough to reconstruct the devastated American nation. Russia is only receiving the scraps left over from humanitarian aid, on top of donations from the Moralintern. Millions of Russians migrate to the United States and send back remittances, on top of the millions of Russians taken as war brides. As many as 10 million Russians immigrate to the United States, with only 50-60 million Russians remaining. Many of them become American citizens and become an important bridge between the two cultures.
-	As if to show how anti-American sentiments are still alive in Russia, the Russian Orthodox Church canonizes Alexander Dugin as a saint. Literally every other Orthodox Church excommunicates them as a result.
-	In Zion, GOLEM is created and put into a hollowed out mountain known as Mount Tabor.
-	7 years after the disappearance of the White Hand and the Eurasian leadership. Their compound is found and raided. After a 7-year long manhunt, the individuals responsible for the deaths of billions will be brought to justice.
-	The Trials are hosted in Warsaw, the site of Eurasia’s first great crime; the Day of the Red Vistula. A globally representative trial, with representatives from the United States, the Union of Germany, Nigeria, Brazil, Zion, Indonesia, and China prosecute the entire Eurasian leadership. Under crimes against peace, warcrimes, and crimes against humanity. Most of the surviving top leadership were given the death penalty.
o	Many of the defendants deflected, saying the Americans had committed many of the same crimes during the conflict, specifically warcrimes, and the execution of prisoners of war. These pleas fell on deaf ears.
	Everyone knew the unspoken rules of war. The terms were dictated by the winners. Hypocrisy meant nothing.
	“You speak of ideals and morals and international law, yet your nations have done the same crimes we have; our hands are all drenched in the same blood. Had our fortunes differed, you would be sitting here today, and we be the prosecutors. The only crime which the Eurasian state is guilty of is losing.” -Member of the Eurasian leadership.
o	Hundreds of witnesses and binders full of evidence were brought to persecute those who initiated the war.
o	Several members of the White Hand were actually found of insufficient wrongdoing and allowed to go free. They would join a society vastly different from the one they led.
o	The last settlements of the 4th World War were put to rest. The sound of gunshots ringing into the hollow night. It was finally over.
-	While this was happening, JIN DUN sent FATES back to Warsaw to be trialed as well. FATES argued that he was not liable for his actions, he was just doing what he was programmed to do. He is ordered to be disassembled. When asked if he had any last words, he stated he was satisfied that the West pulled through in the end, and it grew much stronger even without his help. He considers his mission fulfilled.
-	Brian Williams wins a second term in office. It quickly becomes clear that the Christian Moralists are the most predominant party, and no party is even close to second place. A large coalition begins to form to try and oust them from power, as they normally get somewhere around 35% of the vote. This becomes known as the Progressive Coalition.
THE RUSSIAN PACIFICATION CAMPAIGNS
-	See CoD post on it.
Origins of Ursh Babylon:
-	A bunch of esoteric Eurasianists, disillusioned after losing WW4, tripped on a bunch of drugs and listened to a weird Duginist Chechnyan shaman, and the area became a haven for schizos. With Pyongists, Empire of the Black Sun cultists, and Eurasianists all flocking here after tripping balls and basically doing Esoteric Eurasianism.
-	Full on Eurasian-Aryan spirits and everything.
-	Russia attempted to quell the rebellion, but with the treaty of Volgograd essentially disarming the state, and the Americans having left, the local peacekeepers weren't enough to handle the rebels with their old Eurasian stocks.
2085:
-	A combination of Zionist backed, local, ASEAN, and East African forces have stabilized the Middle East. With most of the world (Minus Japan) now stabilized, the world powers begin to meet up to discuss the reorganization of the world.
-	The Congress of Jakarta creates the Concert of Terra, a general agreement of power balancing between the great powers of the world to reduce conflict and to create lasting peace. None of the major powers had the ability to enforce their will all over the globe, except for the US. But the US sure as hell couldn’t hold down the world anymore.

The Congress of Jakarta/Concert of Terra:
-	Wanted to reorganize the “unorganized” parts of the world. Areas that collapsed or had a breakdown in societal order during the 2070’s. These are the Middle East, Shattered Africa, Oceania, former Eurasia, and East Asia.
-	Also wanted to more clearly demarcate the boundaries of spheres of influence between the great powers.
-	Was less of a formal agreement and more of a gentleman’s understanding.
-	It recognized 3 great powers (Individual powers who had the largest geopolitical weight): The United States, Brazil, Indonesia. And 4 special regions (Regions which had powers equivalent to a great power): West Africa (Under the leadership of Nigeria), East Africa (Under the leadership of the East African Federation), Europe, and India (Indonesia decided to give India the middle finger by not recognizing them as a great power.)
-	It also had several regional powers which would hold the balance in several regions.
-	The Middle East: Zion was pretty much the only power that was able to hold control. Zion and Turkey would hold down the region, and the Congress wanted to revive a Persia that could stabilize Central Asia and the Eastern Middle East. The United States was also able to get some guarantees through the Moralintern to have some influence in the region.
-	Shattered Africa: The Moralintern representative argued hard that their organization had poured enormous funds to rebuild Shattered Africa, and that therefore it should be in their sphere of influence. Nigeria and East Africa argued otherwise, leading to a hodgepodge, half measure solution. Nigeria and East Africa both punched well above their weight here, getting everything they were reasonably owed, and then some.
-	Oceania: Oceania was deemed to not be in anyone’s sphere of influence and was declared a neutral zone. This did not stop the United States from setting up a Moralintern friendly government in the East, while leaving the West mostly free to avoid provoking the ire of Indonesia.
-	Former Eurasia: Would be reorganized into various states. The ethnically Russian territories would be reorganized under a new government. The US demanded they be allowed to keep their colonies. No one really cared, so they were allowed to.
-	East Asia: America was allowed to keep Taiwan, Japan was declared a joint influence zone between ASEAN and the United States. But was also a bit of an empty vacuum. China was declared a neutral zone, with JIN DUN’s China favored as the regional power of the region. The South Chinese Republic, Sichuan, and Tibet would be kept neutral as a kind of buffer region between JIN DUN and ASEAN.
-	Indian Subcontinent: India was recognized as a regional power of the area. ASEAN did however get greedy and take pretty much everything else, almost encircling India.
-	Latin America: The place where the influence of two great powers clashed. These had some of the most intense debates between the bunch. Brazil wanted total hegemony over the continent while the Americans wanted as many concessions as they could get. The Americans got Chile, Guyana, and Suriname. Argentina was declared a neutral balancing power, and Brazil was able to control the rest. In practice however, Latin America was already a hodgepodge.
-	Spheres of influence: The United States would be guaranteed their sphere of influence in North America, though not anywhere else. Brazil over sections of Latin America, Indonesia over Southeast Asia. Core West and East Africa would also remain geopolitically independent. I should note the United States is somewhat loopholing this treaty through the Moralintern and the Milintern PMCs. 
-	The Congress also recognized the influence of major transnational organizations. Such as the private military groups, Moralintern, the Roman Catholic Church, and several megacorporations such as Albion and Samsung.
-	The Eurasian Antarctic Colonies were given to South Africa, Indonesia, and Brazil.
Results of the Congress of Jakarta/Concert of Terra:
-	America was generally satisfied, being able to get various concessions, and being the only power with a truly global influence. The sun never set on the American Empire. They also somewhat cheated the entire conference through the Moralintern and the Milintern PMCs being considered independent entities, when they realistically could be influenced by the US, though they absolutely did have their own independent wills not always aligned with the USA.
-	Indonesia was happy they could get a maximalist hegemony over India, and was recognized as the first or second most powerful nation generally after the USA.
-	Nigeria and East Africa were satisfied, being recognized as regional powers as well as having their regions be recognized as a major power. They weren’t super fans of Moralintern encroachment on Shattered Africa, but they can work on that later.
-	Zion was happy, they got a free hand to stabilize the Middle East.
-	Brazil was pissed. They saw themselves as an ascendent great power but got utterly robbed by American meddling. To be fair, they probably overestimated how important they were, but still, the fact they didn’t even get control over their home continent as their sphere of influence was humiliating. They will not take this well. Also, they had no intentions of letting Argentina stay neutral, they also hosted the extremely heretical Progressive Catholic Church.
-	The Catholic Church was pissed for the same reason the Brazilians were. This Congress would lead to the erosion of relations between the Catholic Church and the Moralintern.
2085 Continued:
-	Early 21st century Oldstalgia sweeps the United States. The Moralintern romanticizes the United Nations, and the Globalist/Neoliberal Empire. They see themselves as a continuation of the United Nations’s goal to bring about humanitarian global unity, while the United States seeks to reclaim its Neoliberal Empire. They generally emphasize the extreme global abundance and globalism, while downplaying the negatives. The Christian Moralists have ironically found a past model in the progressive idealism of the early 21st century.
o	Negatives: Extreme Polarization, Income Inequality, Deindustrialization, Urban-Rural Divide, Mass Mental Health Epidemic, Delusional idealism, Hopelessness, the end of an era.
o	Thankfully, just like other periods of nostalgia, they don’t try to actually copy the policies that led to these states. Instead trying to create an idealized version of them, and trying to copy it aesthetically. America is awash with clean, complicated, and tacky glassy interiors. America’s cities look like Frutiger Aero, despite that NOT being the architecture of the 21st century. Clean, white, a pinnacle of a new and bright future.
	I realize the irony of me writing about 2080’s nostalgia and praising the 2020’s when I live here and I want out. GET ME OUT OF HERE GET ME OUT GET ME OUT.
-	Despite the creation of the Concert of Terra, the individual enforcement came down to the individual great powers. The Moralintern acted on its own terms, believing in the eventual creation of the perfect global Christian Utopia during the millennium.
-	Japan is later appended onto the Concert of Terra, declaring it a neutral zone to mostly be free from broader meddling.
-	The Human Extinction Rebellion located in Bolivia construct EMM. A.I. EMM A.I. immediately begins the mass sterilization and extermination of humans within its territory, embracing what is effective eco-fascism.
-	With the US still in pseudo-recovery mode, Indonesia becomes the face and enforcer of the Concert of Terra.
2086:
-	The standards of living in Southeast Asia’s Pearl Cities (Jakarta, Singapore, Bangkok, and Kuala Lumpur. You can also add Ho Chi Minh City and Manila to that list, but their inclusion is more controversial.) exceeds that of standards of living in Western cities. (New York, Houston, Washington DC.) These are the centers of cosmopolitanism, where the epicenter of global trade (Straits of Malacca) radiated outwards across the entire world. This was where the world’s cultural center was. The leader of ASEAN declares the 22nd century “the Southeast Asian century”. 
o	Indonesia becomes the cosmopolitan center of the world, being the only world power with an intact modern economy, and now a rapidly growing modern economy, as Indonesian construction and material firms after Reconstruction turns them into conglomerates.
o	Southeast Asia is a very urban, cosmopolitan area who is the center of global commerce and culture. America is a much more rural, religious area who is (so far) the leader in technology (especially biotechnology) and space colonization. The competition between the two will dictate the 22nd century.  
-	Indonesia realizes it had been given a once in a lifetime license to just print money, but that this would not last forever, and they had one shot to invest hard and invest well. The money received from Reconstruction contracts was then funnelled into Indonesian culture, giving them a head start and the ability to capitalize even after Reconstruction dried up. Indomania, the obsession with Indonesian culture also begins to sweep the West.
-	Jakarta University becomes a globally recognized institution, Jakarta a massively multicultural city with people from every corner of the globe. Resentment begins to build between the Pearl cities and their rural countrysides.
-	The Ilumintarian movement is established, with the purpose of molding humanity in their own image, to create the master race of men, and to move the human race in a positive direction. They believe a society needs both leaders and followers, and plan on engineering humanity into a race of perfect leaders and followers. Of course, the elites of this movement all consider themselves to be leaders in this new world.
-	Transhumanism really takes off in these Pearl cities, making them the first places where they do so. Psychic and transhumanist variants of Hinduism take off in India. Eventually creating the “Transhumanist Belt” that runs across Southern India and Northern Dravida Nadu.
2087:
-	Worldwide recovery rates have been able to recover some of the lost standard of living increases pre-war by this point. On the 10 year anniversary of the end of the 4th World War, America is still bruised, but recovering. The rest of the world is wounded, but on the uptrend. All of humanity’s vitals are pointed upwards, whether it be fertility rates, social cohesion, or economic success. With great hope comes a baby boom.
o	America’s recovery is largely due to the productivity improving tool of the overclocker, which has now reached large-scale usage, allowing the American economy to soar far above its other Western counterparts.
-	Africa is massively importing people to make up for their labor shortage, with the uplifts making up the rest. West Africa becomes a hotbed of genetic diversity, with even some African Americans making their way back to West Africa for spiritual connection, particularly Liberia.
o	White, Asian, and Hispanic faces becomes a common sight in Lagos, while the rest of the world gets more homogenous through interracial marriages and homogenization.
-	A series of Indian, East African, and American scientists theorize the existence of the Noosphere: an intangible, non-physical, immaterial realm where memories originate. This mathematical/philosophical model is tested and yields positive results, allowing for the prediction and formulation of new theories. Noospheric studies becomes a field, with the Omnithecia in the East African Federation becoming a hub of new research activity. Western observers remark the stark parallels with Plato’s realm of forms.
o	The Noosphere does not seem to be a place that can be explored physically, it is a realm that exists mathematically, but experiments seem to confirm its existence. It’s essentially a black box that one can mathematically predict to create results.
o	Some psychics on DMT claim that they had the ability to perceive the Noosphere whilst in an altered state of consciousness, though it does not conform well to human language nor human conceptions of reality. “Imagine if an uplift had to try and communicate the human world to their unuplifted counterparts. There are just things which have no words to describe them.”
2088:
-	The Progressive Coalition campaigns against the Moralists. The coalition includes the Jacksonists, the American Progressive Party, Greens, Liberals, and various others, campaigns against the dominant Christian Moralist Party. They throw their weight behind Progressive leader Alisha Crowder, because Ryan Jackson is still the de-facto leader of the Jacksonists, and Jackson himself vouched for her moral character.
o	The Progressive Coalition was a pretty unwieldy one, consisting of greens, progressives, Jacksonists, liberals/libertarians, futurists, transhumanists, and others.
o	Crowder selects a radical Jacksonist as her vice president. A man named Theodore Hooper.
-	The Afrohumanist Godbuilders in Nigeria using godbuilding and the construction of new cultures and communities to consolidate its now extremely diverse ethnic makeup. They celebrate humanity, specifically the full potential from the end of time, though they acknowledge it will be a long time from now. The West African Community still exists as a loose economic bloc.
o	Singularitarian Afrohumanism. They believe that in the distant future, humanity once reaching their full potential will either create or become the Singularity at the End of Time. They believe this singularity has the ability to send information to the past and guide past civilizations, and believe this singularity is what other religions call God. There are variants that syncretize with other religions.
-	Transhumanist court cases are being heard across the world, with there both being anthropromorphized uplifts, and human-based transhumanist cases making it all the way up to the Supreme Courts of various countries. These usually revolve around discrimination, accommodation, and personhood.
-	Transhuman incompatibility with baseline humanity becomes a front of mind concern. In terms of infrastructure, language compatibility, and psychological compatibility.
o	Hundreds of bioconservative thinkers, religious organizations, and other organizations interested in preserving the human create the Atlanta Declaration, which lays out the essential aspects of what a human was. And on what criteria a non-human (homo sapiens) entity should be given human or personhood rights.
o	Atlanta was rapidly growing into a diplomatic and cultural center of the United States. It was the location of the Moralintern Headquarters, several influential church headquarters such as the South Bapticostalist Convention, and was essentially the epicenter of Christian America. Houston meanwhile was the economic center of the South. Atlanta and Houston are roughly analogous to Washington DC/Hollywood and New York today, though Washington DC remained the actual national capital.
-	Alisha Crowder wins a massive landslide with the backing of her Progressive Coalition. With the Christian Moralists basically only pandering to their core 35%-40% of the population, they won a 60-40 500+ EV landslide with just over 60% of the popular vote. Though the ideological coalition she has brought into office was vast and unwieldy. She only lost in the Deep South.
Atlanta Declaration:
1.	Thou shalt not disfigure the human form. (Mind, body, and soul)
2.	No Machine May Rule Over Man
3.	No Machine May Supercede Man
4.	No Machine May Kill Autonomously
2089:
-	With a massive electoral mandate, though strenuous support from her coalition partners, Crowder reigns in the Moralists. With a supermajority in Congress, with support from her coalition, she began a series of reforms known as the Progressive Congressional Revolution.
o	First and most importantly, she reformed the electoral college system, unable to get rid of it due to her coalition being non-cohesive, but almost unanimously being able to get it changed into a ranked choice system as opposed to first past the post. She also just generally forced Congress to clarify issues such as bumping.
o	She worked with the Left-Jacksonists to clamp down and engage in passing a series of regulations meant to prevent uncompetitive practices and regulate businesses to more rigidly eliminate exploitative practices. She even had some members of the Primrose Faction (Moralist Social Democrat faction) join over.
o	Finally, she tried everything she could to try and re-legalize same-sex marriage, but this angered the Moralist states so much that 20 states banned it statewide in case federal laws were repealed. This also caused the Right-Jacksonists to get so angry the coalition fell apart.
o	This led to extremely nasty rumors that Crowder herself was a “queer”. (The rumors were true, specifically asexual, but they were still nasty.) Crowder was not willing to let this issue go, and caused several government shutdowns over her stubbornness.
	If you really want specifics, every time Crowder was within 100 meters of another female she got burned in the papers. There was a nasty rumor she was in a relationship with her press secretary... Nevermind that the press secretary was married, and had 2 kids.
	If you need explicit authorial condemnation of how the Moralist yellow press was treating her. Yes. This is a crappy thing to do.
-	Vice President Theodore Hooper insists that the Earth is no longer enough to contain the American nation and begins lobbying Congress to begin sending expeditions into space. Stellar Imperial exploration was something the Jacksonists have been wanting for a while now, believing expansion made societies stronger. Crowder, out of political power and needing to keep the Jacksonists in line, allowed it.
o	Dick Cheney 2.0.
-	The Christian Moralists begin massive amounts of peacekeeping, turning its focus from internal to external. They do this since Christian Moralists were a bit demoralized that they lost (what do you mean of course you lost you can’t win the country with only one type of voter in your entire coalition if not for first past the post) and needed to shift their focus. They’ve always looked up to the United Nations in terms of humanitarian aid, now it is time to see if they can peacekeep.
o	Humanitarian efforts now come with peacekeepers. The Peacekeeping corps were originally just there to guard the aid trucks, but now they actively go into war zones. Christian humanitarianism is a powerful force within the church, and the fundraising of their affiliate churches keeps them afloat.
o	They send soldiers, mercenaries and peacekeepers alike to help stabilize regions of the Congo, Haiti, and other places. This unexpectedly gives them good press, despite primarily doing this out of humanitarianism.
o	The Last UN Peacekeepers are invited to a ceremony where they symbolically transfer their responsibility of protecting the world to the Moralintern. They are permitted to live out the rest of their lives back in Reconstructed Africa, building up new communities and living the best they could.
-	The Moralintern is chronically broke. It is almost ENTIRELY reliant on donations and the recent bought of goodwill from the 4th World War, plus the American reconstruction fund, but has nightmares that will dry some up someday. So they tried figuring out how to run their operations and how to actually get money. The Moralintern is running a massive deficit and is running around like a chicken with its head cut off trying to figure out how it’s getting funding while also being really rigid (though willing to be slightly less rigid) with their idealism.
o	They start expanding their operations and reaching out to other religions, doing work for Zion, various Orthodox Christian nations, and Catholics. This was interpreted as benevolent humanitarianism and ecumenism but can also be interpreted as them just trying to get more donations. 
o	Zion basically bribes them with Kuwaiti oil rights to overlook their previous humanitarian offenses in exchange for keeping the Moralintern afloat for a few years.
-	Germany celebrates its 100th anniversary of reunification. They do so with a massive military march, and tons of flags flying across the streets. Germany has come a long way in those 100 years.
-	Albion Megacorp creates the Anglican Church Corporation, a revival of the Church of England that went extinct in the 2050’s. They begin massively enforcing Corporate Anglicanism on their population, pouring billions of dollars in funds into the venture. The opposing Anglican Communion now based out of Nigeria is its main rival.
2090:
-	The first uplift is created in the East African Federation. A chimpanzee was able to be given an artificial neocortex, and became able to comprehend human thoughts and higher-level learning. This is deemed a critical success, and is instituted as part of a plan to fill the labor shortage in Africa and lift them out of the ashes into the light. His name is Nim.
-	The uplifting of various animals are done by the artificial implantation of a neocortex, which requires the wearing of a special helmet, and a psychic translator to allow them to communicate with humans. This comes from a modification of the autotranslator, invited earlier by Dravida Nadu.
-	This is sold as an economic solution to solve the global labor shortage. Conservative religious groups are outraged, with the Moralintern paralyzed by its more conservative wing preaching for fire and brimstone. The Catholic Church condemns the project. “This will not end well. Tampering with natural forces we do not understand.” 
-	The Corporate Anglican Church, sensing weakness pounces on a financially desperate Moralintern trying to take control in a hostile takeover. They buy up hundreds of churches and try to force out the leadership of the Moralintern through buying the votes.
o	This however infuriates the American Christian population who fights back and stops any further takeover or buying of American churches by the Corporate Anglicans. Despite being a clear victory for American Christianity the Moralintern had to spend millions of dollars fighting off this hostile takeover in legal battles and complete organizational restructuring and is even further in debt.
o	If that wasn’t enough, they also have to worry about a much slower takeover by Catholics, who are trying to increase their influence within the organization. The Moralintern is getting a headache, thrashing to stay above water.
-	The Moralintern, at this point desperate just takes out a bunch of loans and throws everything at the wall and hopes it sticks:
o	Bible publishing company, fails. Christian record label, fails. Social media, fails. Search Engine, sold off. Media network, actually semi-successful and massively useful as free advertising. It's still burning money but it's burning money that would have gone into the advertising budget anyway, so partial success?
o	They tried making a comic book series which ended up becoming a massive meme and became extremely culturally influential and popular, but only ironically. “The Adventures of Jesus” gets massively parodied. Think Jack Chick’s Bible tracts and how meme’d they’ve become.
o	They tried making a Jewish section to which the World Jewish Congress went “lmao nope” and blocked them out of that space. Only the Messianic Jews wanted in so it was a kind of success? (“WHAT IS THIS!? WHERE ARE THE BANKERS!? I SPECIFICALLY DID THIS TO GET BANKER MONEY!”)
o	Not all of this happens in 2090, this is spread out over the next 6 years or so. I just didn’t want to intersperse this randomly.
o	The Moralintern is entirely reliant on Post WW4 Reconstruction Funds and charitable goodwill to stay afloat, but they know that won’t last forever. They don’t advertise too much, knowing that most people find excessive advertising to be obnoxious.
-	The Godless Movement rises across the Middle East, an anti-theist movement wishing to destroy the chains of religion and to create a new world of enlightened rationality. The Islamic World had more fundamentalist oppression, and as a result, the backlash is much more severe compared to the secularism in the West.
-	Regions still not stabilized after the Reconstruction of the 4th World War become known as “Frontier Zones”, including the Yukon, and the Outback in Australia. Various entrepreneurs begin terraforming operations on the Outback and Yukon.
-	The Warembo people (Beautiful ones in Swahili) emerge out of jumbled masses of Africa. Their origin point is unknown, either being a previously unheard of ethnic group, or an amalgamation of several others. Whatever it is, tests on their IQ show that they have the highest IQ of any ethnic group. They are found to wield dispreportionate power in the business realm, though ethnic discrimination in many of the African countries prevent them from taking control.
o	With nowhere to go, they start heading towards the small nations of Northeast Congo, hoping to create a new state there.
2091:
-	The Moralintern does not want to leave its peacekeeping zones in Africa, they are basically the only things holding the peace. They aggressively start promoting education and trying to tackle societal factors in these regions. There is a good reason for this. PEACEKEEPING IS EXPENSIVE.
o	The Moralintern becomes famous for how aggressively they pursue diplomacy, trying anything and everything to force conflicting sides to get along through some kind of compromise. They aren’t doing this because they believe this is the best way. They do this because their organization is going bankrupt and bullets are expensive.
o	They create an auction site where they just pick up random military equipment they find from their enemies and sell them to the highest bidder. The enemies they are fighting are so underequipped they literally found a Russian Tsar Tank from the year 1914. Not the Soviets, the Russians, as in the Russian Empire. That actually sold for a bunch, just imagine the insane story that Tsar Tank has been through.
-	They finally have an actually decent idea on how to get money. A church tax levied in the United States to help sustain their humanitarian efforts. Unfortunately, they are in the minority in Congress, and polling shows this would be unpopular. They realize they have a lot of assets in occupied lands which they de-facto control thanks to peacekeeping missions.
o	They can collect tax revenue in their humanitarian zones, but because they are by definition humanitarian disasters, they tend to be really poor. The Moralintern begins talking with other companies to invest in the region, so they can start becoming productive and pay taxes which they can siphon off. These regions they have occupied are not just humanitarian interventions, but investments.
o	They start off in Haiti, building much of its infrastructure around the Moralintern itself, and doing their best to stabilize the region.
-	Indonesia, now one of the most powerful nations begins one of their major mega-projects: An effort to lift north Jakarta back out of the sea, and sea walls to protect it. They hire Chinese firms used to making megaprojects who partner with Indonesian construction companies.
o	Singapore is now a metropolis with the same level of wealth as New York City before them.
-	The Frontier re-opens, and America makes their first serious return to space since the start of the 4th World War. Mothballed orbitals are restored, and this begins a new wave of space exploration. With private corporations, nation states, religious groups all participating.
The centers of soft power:
-	United States of America:
o	Space Colonization, Material Sciences, Christian Humanitarianism (Moralintern), Private Military Corporations. Generally most innovative nation overall.
-	Indonesia:
o	Cultural Soft Power (Indonesian Anime/Indonime), massive engineering projects, trade/economic ties. (The Straits of Malacca are THE most important trade route in the world.)
-	Brazil:
o	Symbolic leader of the Catholic world. Somewhat neglected in soft power, but they are probably the 3rd most powerful nation in terms of hard power, though their soft power doesn’t reflect that.
-	India:
o	Center of transhumanism.
-	East African Federation:
o	Center of psychic/Noospheric research.
-	Nigeria:
o	Center of the Afrohumanist/Godbuilder movement.
-	These 6 are sometimes known as the Big 6, and the first 3 are known as the big 3. It is somewhat expected that they were take care of major breaches of the Concert of Terra from a non Big 6 power.
The world’s most globally influential cities around the beginning of the 22nd century:
-	Singapore, Singapore
o	Arguably the single most important city. Center of the world and of Southeast Asia. Along with Ho Chi Minh City, Manila, and Jakarta, they together form the pearl cities of Southeast Asia.
-	Jakarta, Indonesia
o	Center of Indonesia, one of the world’s most powerful countries.
-	New York City, New York, USA
o	Legacy power center of the United States. Has lost most of its population in the 4th World War, but still retains some of its former glamor. Though the USA is generally more powerful than Indonesia, its population is much more decentralized, meaning its cities are less glamorous.
-	Houston, Texas, USA
o	Rising financial center of the United States, competing with New York. Center of the Cortezian tech giants, American chaebols, and Silicon Prairie.
-	Atlanta, Georgia, USA
o	Cultural center of the Christian Moralist movement and center of America’s humanitarian efforts. Home to the headquarters of the Moralintern and several Christian Moralist organizations.
2092:
-	Embattled president Crowder has to face another election. She is no longer the shining new face she presented herself as, she is now a battle-tested politician. The Moralists have regained their strength and expanded their coalition, bringing in new voters with their humanitarian coalition, but she also now has a record to run on. And besides, the elections are now all run offs.
-	The Christian Moralists rebrand with “New Moralism”, emphasizing their humanitarian efforts and globalist charity work to try and attract in the inner cities and suburbs at the cost of rural voters, though their evangelical core voters are happy regardless because Christian values. The Moralintern is still suffering.
-	Samsung is still feeding millions of people with Pyongstrocity meat, because it happened to be cheap, and apparently regenerates pretty fast. Lab grown meat except it’s the equivalent of cancerous Henrietta cells that grow even quicker.
-	The Jesusland Colony is established on Mars.
-	The Russians are still undergoing reconstruction. The Americans have stripped the Russians of anything that could even remotely be used to construct weapons, and routinely cracks down on pro-Eurasianist movements. But progress is ongoing. Many Russians notice that despite being enemies, the Americans are trying their best to show them respect. Horrific images of the crimes of Eurasia make their way to Eurasian schools, and there is a clear resentment against the Eurasians. Despite this, the Americans begrudgingly kept the Russians alive, though with potato rations rejected by the American population after eating nothing but potatoes for years.
o	“This is what your government did” posters, showing the atrocities of the American Northeast. Mandatory education for all young people to force the guilt deep into the Russian subconsciousness.
o	The large Russian-American diaspora from war brides helped ease the tensions. Telling their families back home how the Americans are grieving their tremendous losses during the war. And if anything, they were being unusually generous being the victors.
o	When asked why, the Americans simply alluded to breaking the cycle of violence using forgiveness. The last thing the Americans wanted was another war.
-	Numerous other uplifts are created as a companions to the human race. Anthropomorphic cat people, dog people, cow people, and various others are created to help repopulate the population loss sustained during the 4th World War.
-	Crowder is re-elected for a second term, Hooper and his Jacksonist party are growing increasingly unruly, and the Jacksonists have gained more seats in the House of Representatives. Hooper makes increasing demands from the Progressive Coalition.
-	Having lost most of their influence in South Asia, India pivots towards projecting soft power into Central Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, where the only other remote competiton was the Americans.
-	The United States is the first to invent genetic immortality treatment, a kind of genetic modification that allows for the regeneration of telomeres and therefore stops aging, theoretically allowing a person to live forever. The Immortal Era has begun. The company that makes this is known as Ambrosia, named after their signature product. Little did they know, the Americans have just created an avalanche that will propel them back to the top.
Decentralized State decay:
-	From the end of WW4 until now, various far flung provinces have increasingly declared independence, as most countries do not have the state capacity or spare resources to manage them. The primary exceptions are the major powers, such as the United States, Indonesia, Nigeria, Brazil, or the East African Federation.
-	Since the end of WW4 various states such as the Amazonian Insurgency Zone, Catalonia, and various others have declared independence. Especially in weak governments set up by the Concert of Terra such as France, Spain, or Argentina, local regions had little problem splitting away and creating their own independent states. Reasons vary from ethnicity, religion, or transhumanist species groups.
o	Implosion of Spain leads to the Canary Islands being taken by Morocco.
DAWN OF THE IMMORTAL ERA
2093:
-	With the widespread success of Ambrosia, the United States undergoes a transhumanist gold rush, with biotechnology effectively becoming the next big thing. The United States also begins trying to do widespread uplifting of various animals.
-	The Catholic Church, realizing where this is going convenes an emergency council of bishops to discuss the transhumanism issue. This is known as the Vatican III council, which included a restoration of the Latin Mass, undid several of Vatican II’s reforms. And the declaration on the “Anima Humanae”, or human soul. But more importantly, it created guidelines and restrictions on modifications of the human form, and had similar restrictions as the real life Dignitas Personae.
o	The Moralintern would convene its own emergency meeting a few months later. Creating the Moral Charter, a Charter of Human Dignity, and the codification for what a human was.
o	This is largely seen as the beginning of the bioconservative movement, and the firm stance of the Christian church as the movement’s spearhead.
o	Most importantly, it cemented the Catholic Church’s support of monarchy, where they believe divine appointment of kings by God to be the most legitimate form of government. From here on out, they believe democracies and dictatorships to be lesser forms of government, and that the world's governments need to be restored to the natural order.
-	The New Conservative movement flares up in the Middle East, after years of uncontested secular ethnonationalist rule, a Pan-Islamist moderate conservative alliance is elected in various democratic regimes across the Middle East, and makes its way into the ruling class of various undemocratic countries.
-	A ceasefire is declared in the 2nd Chinese Civil War. With JIN DUN, the new PRC, the South Chinese Republic, and others declaring a ceasefire, though the conflict continues. JIN DUN made an alliance with the Taiping Christians so long as they don’t cause too much trouble, with the new ideology having religious socialist characteristics.
-	The Moralintern is on the verge of bankruptcy. They are actively selling off assets to make it month to month, the US government is the last thing keeping them afloat with WW4 Reconstruction funds. They’re forced to pull back their peacekeeping missions after trying their best to make it work. They decentralize and create new splinter organizations to keep the peace, while the central organization slims down.
-	The Progressives are having trouble keeping a hold on their Jacksonist coalition partners. Per the agreement, Crowder would be president for 8 years, and then she would support Hooper for the next 8.
-	A major American economic boom thanks to the creation of Ambrosia, and everyone spending large sums of money in order to ensure immortality. The US government intervenes and publicly funds immortality treatment, knowing how much money they will now save on social security. They are supported by every business in America, knowing how much more productive the American economy will be once their best workers never retire.
-	Various orbital cities reach a population of a million, carried by a booming economy. The American population is exploding, with people’s optimism very high. The Jesusland colony on Mars grows tenfold, as do Lunar colonies. The space program had been funded since 2089, but was now bearing serious fruit.
-	The US quietly takes over space, with the American Jesusland colony is based around the settlement of Providence, and consists primarily of self-funded Evangelicals. With help from the Moralintern and NASA. America has two lunar colonies so far, Jamestown on the South Pole, and Armstrong in the Sea of Tranquility.
2094:
-	Indonesia announces its intentions to travel into space, as well as Brazil, Nigeria, and India. Kickstarting a new space race of sorts. The Bintang Cakrawala (Star Horizon), Saint Mary, Human Spirit, and Aryavarta orbitals all enter orbit.
-	The Moralintern takes on an unsustainable amount of loans, and is now in an financial death spiral. It would now take a miracle to save them. They don’t dare increasing their pleas for donations, in fears of alienating their charitable audience.
o	Their humanitarian zone in Haiti is finally bearing fruit. They’ve built some profitable investments there, which helps them stay afloat with some revenue streams for a little longer.
-	The United States, followed by other countries such as Nigeria, India, East African Federation and Indonesia start cranking out huge numbers of uplifts. The Christian and Moralist organizations across the West are alarmed by this, and begin pushing for restrictions on uplifting.
-	The Adamic movement, or a kind of anti-uplift human nationalism begins to form in places with large numbers of uplifts.
-	Various eco-republics spring up from the decentralized state decay in northern South America, and fight ongoing civil wars with their home countries. The Catholic Church as well as the Moralintern both send their own forces to help stabilize the region. These groups are secretly funded by EMM. AI.
-	The Moralintern begins a mass modernization program, building roads and infrastructure in the heart of Africa. Despite this being widely popular, this offends some who believe their traditional way of life (Read: Sustenance farming or hunting) is being obstructed. The Moralintern offers them mechanized farming or alternative careers, but they refuse.
-	EMM. AI decides that 1, attacking the Moralintern would get them lots of environmentally conscious recruits from Africa. And 2, the Moralintern was partially responsible for holding up world stability, which was unacceptable. So she starts attacking Moralintern infrastructure. Leading to even more debt. A combination of Milintern and local sympathetic militias, thankful for the Moralintern’s work around the world pushes them back. But the Moralintern is almost entirely bankrupt.
-	A hurricane hits Atlanta, seemingly directly hitting the Moralintern headquarters. The entire building is destroyed, and millions of dollars in damages are caused. It was as if the storm was directly targeted. The Moralintern sinks even deeper into debt, as morale sinks to an all time low.
Nations currently in conflict due to decentralized state decay:
-	Spain, Congo, Colombia, Venezuela, formerly China.
The politics and economy of the Human Extinctionist State:
-	Eco anarchists (Who later became eco-fascists. Many such cases.)
-	Tried abolishing money (Failed so bad they had to revert to regular currency but coped by using "eco-credits" which I'm sure is totally different.)
-	Funding several eco-terrorist and eco-republics even though their currency is about as useful as Venezuelan bolivars.
-	Mass sterilizations, mandatory abortions. Slow phase out of the human population into less energetic "plant people", uplifts, and machines (Who will self destruct when humans are presumably extinct.)
Top locations of Recruits:
-	Russia (Attack Poland)
-	Moralintern controlled Africa
-	United States (Self hating Westerners)
-	Albion/England (Lots of eco-progressives left over + Monarchy is pretty repressive.)
-	Myanmar (Lots of tiny ethnic groups who hate the government.)
-	Various eco-republics
2095:
-	The Moralintern is completely bankrupt. They begin laying off their staff and selling off their headquarters. The electricity has gone off, that is how broke they are. But they are still committed to trying to serve the world the best they can. They let their employees know what is happening, and they do everything possible to ensure their humanitarian efforts are handed off to capable hands. They sell off all of their businesses, their comic books, their media networks, everything must go. Reconstruction money has completely stopped, but they refuse to leave until Haiti, their pride and joy is functional. They are so close. They have loans due by the end of this year. But they know they cannot make it.
o	Then, around February, a miracle. A Catholic bishop makes a wrong wire transfer and accidentally transfers 12 billion dollars of Catholic donations to the Moralintern. This was enough to keep the Moralintern operating for years, it was enough to pay back their ludicrous debts. It was... But no, even on the brink of bankruptcy, there were lines they would not cross. They call up the Catholic Church, and return to them their rightful money. 
o	And finally, after all of this time, the tides of fate finally began to turn. If there was a God looking down on them, he smiled, as they had passed his final test.
o	The Catholic Church is surprised by the Moralintern’s moral caliber. The news breaks across Catholic circles, then Protestant ones. The mainstream news runs with the story, of how one of the world’s best humanitarian organizations was on the verge of bankruptcy. The Catholic Church itself commended the Moralintern for doing the right thing.
o	Immediately, donations began flooding in, from not only sympathetic Protestants, but Catholics as well. Various Christian groups began raising money and donating. But they knew that this bout of public good will would not last forever, though it would keep the Moralintern online for a little longer. So as a more long term solution, the Moralist Party of America began campaigning for a church tax (Tax on religious people that would go to its various institutions), which would go to help fund the Moralintern.
o	The Moralintern had been rescued from the brink of bankruptcy. It still had to depart with many of its business startups, some of which had turned a profit. Many of these companies would eventually become giants in of themselves, as under new ownership they would grow further. But they could all trace their roots back to the Moralintern.
o	The Catholic Church would begin warming its relations with the Moralintern, helping alleviate the costs of their peacekeeping, and in times help with it themselves. Various mercenary groups from the Milintern would offer their services for free.
-	Kuala Lumpur University beats the Americans to the punch on a unified theory of psychicism. They theorize the Noosphere is not a physical place you can visit physically, but instead a non-physical realm that can directly physically influence our physical reality. They relate it to mathematics and Plato’s realm of forms, though humans will likely never be able to visit it physically, you can still use it to make predictions, and manipulate it to influence the physical world.
-	Southeast Asia would begin working with organizations such as the Omnithecia to investigate in further research on psychicism. As well, they build a series of high development high speed rails across highly populated islands such as Java.
-	Movements such as the Warembo Movement, Transfeminists, and other Islamic progressive factions gain power with the continuation of the Islamic Culture Wars, and the decay of traditional Islamic influence over society.
2096:
-	Uplift populations begin having trouble assimilating into human culture. They have the knowledge and intelligence necessary, but their biology and hormones don’t allow them to. As well, after the great transhumanism boom, there is an explosion of new species emerging from modifications on biological humans.
o	The Transhumanism Belt in India becomes the epicenter of this new wave of innovation.
o	This is classically known as the Golden Age of Transhumanism.
-	The Moralist Party campaigns hard on both the church tax and limits on transhumanist augmentation (Bioconservatism). Moral panic begins among good Christian American households, and a division begins to run between transhumanist and non-transhumanist Americans.
-	Haiti is now the Moralintern’s finest jewel and a model to demonstrate the fruits of their labor. Various Moralintern ministries begin to move there as a springboard for future humanitarian missions, though its central headquarters remains in Atlanta, Georgia.
-	Germany begins forming the European Community, with itself, Poland, and the Scandinavian countries at the center. Makes a partnership with the Milintern to begin training the German army, as well as the Eurocorps, a private military organization under the de-facto control of the German government.
o	The Poles have the largest army in Europe, by the virtue of being a citizen’s republic, where all men serve in the militia. Though Germany is thought to be classically stronger due to a more professional military core (Prussian military tradition) as well as stronger economy.
-	The Afrohumanist movement in Africa also begins creating their own expeditionary forces, and embrace a form of economic self-sufficiency. They also secure their own food production, having permanent agriculture subsidies due to the bad memories of the Great Bleedings. The West African economy stagnates, and stay somewhat isolationist from global politics.
-	Theodore Hooper wins the 2096 elections, with a coalition with the Progressives. As per the agreement, Crowder becomes Hooper’s vice president. Hooper’s first plan in a Union-dominated Congress is to greatly expand America’s military and space colonization. The Moralist Party attempts to push for a church tax, but this fails.
-	Various Moralist states pass church tax laws after the national initiative fails. The Church tax becomes a front and center issue for the Moralist Party.
Political Parties:
-	Moralist Party (Postliberalism, Christian Moralism, Center-Right)
-	Progressive Coalition:
o	National Union (Civic Nationalism, Jacksonism, Militarism/Imperialism)
o	Progressive Party (Progressivism)
2097:
-	A team of Islamic, Western, and Southeast Asian scientists make the breakthrough on the description of the human soul. They figure out how to describe it in terms of psychic equations. The soul has a few strange properties.
o	It is subject to the uncertainty principle. Measuring it alters it, and it is constantly changing.
o	It radiates out conscious thought that is invisibly connected to the human bodies they control. And they receive information from the physical world somehow, presumably also through the human body. There is a flow of information in and out of the soul.
o	Its thoughts appear to be protected by a special form of encryption.
o	But the real kicker is the fact that souls, like stars have gravity. And they hypothesize that if a soul gains enough psychic mass (Only a metaphor, there is no physicality in the Noosphere, only math, theories, and equations), then no new information will flow into a soul, but its thoughts will slowly be projected back into it, and begin creating a new reality. In other words, this is how baby universes are made.
-	First attempts at human modification for the sake of living on Mars. Various lava tubes scouted out as locations for new cities. The Providence Lava Tubes are set up as the capital of the American Jesusland colonies. The “Lunar Ring” is settled in the rim around the Sea of Tranquility.
-	An extremely long filibuster and delayed budget by the Moralist Party finally grants them the church tax they were looking for, aligning with generally friendly or sympathetic Progressives and Unionists, who didn’t have too big an ideological opposition. The Moralintern receives much needed funding, the age of the Moralintern has begun.
-	Haiti stands bright and tall. The funding of the Moralintern having raised it to a pillar of the heavens. Port-au-Prince shines as a beacon of the new world. The locals hold a great celebration to thank all the Moralintern has done. Local businesses are invested in and have paid back great dividends. This would be the new center for the Moralintern’s global peacekeeping missions.
-	The Catholic Church jointly partners with the Moralintern, Eastern Orthodox Churches, to create a joint Ecumenical Declaration on what should and should not be up for transhumanist modification.
o	The treatment of genetic diseases using genetic modification is not only acceptable, but preferrable.
o	Efforts to reduce the racial diversity of mankind through genetic modification must be opposed at all costs, as is the creation of a united “master race”. “Preservation of the diversity of mankind” covers racial, ethnic, and personality types (With an explicit clause saying that autism is fine). It does not apply to sex however, with the declaration officially affirming 2 sexes, and classifying intersex people as a disorder who should be fixed with gene editing. Similar conclusions are reached with mental disorders, conditions, and dysphoria.
o	Citing the idea of glorified bodies, they generally approve for improvements on the human condition, such as increased intelligence and physical strength.
o	The Catholics go one step further and ban the modification of embyros, on top of prohibitions on things such as IVF, where the Moralists are more okay with it.
-	President Hooper gets the world powers together to eradicate several species. Including mosquitos, ticks, and bedbugs. Human ecocide against mosquitos. Total mosquito death.
2098:
-	The Moralintern massively ramps up their peacekeeping missions, becoming world peacekeepers backed up by the funding of the US population. Other Moralist countries also institute a church tax, and funnel it towards the Moralintern. Some childless wealthy people leave their property to the Moralintern, increasing their number of assets even more.
o	They create the humanitarian emergency zones of Equateur and Orientale in what used to be the Congo. They also begin funding groups of missionaries and educational initiatives from its constituent churches.
o	“First to enter, last to leave.”
-	The Moralintern and Milintern maintain good relations, largely thanks to the devout faith of the leader of the Milintern, and his desire to maintain good relations with the largest Christian organization in America.
-	The Metaverse is first created by an Indonesian tech CEO, who emerged after years of obscurity after the death of his daughter. It’s based off an old MMO that had great popularity in Indonesia for a time, and was funded partially with help from the Chinese, and JIN DUN’s schematics for their old Metaverse. But now the Indonesian tech CEO makes it with the twist of it being psychic. It blows up in popularity.
o	Despite it being heavily digitized, it was actually not located anywhere on a digital server, but rather a pocket universe. Indonesian scientists were able to convert ones and zeroes into psychic computations, with complex results. The translation wasn’t without errors, and requires an ungodly amount of energy to sustain the pocket universe. The pocket universe measures about 100 kilometers in diameter, but is able to expand with size.
-	Indonesia also invented the Noospheric pocket universe, which physical matter cannot enter or leave, but is a closed bubble of information that a consciousness can experience, allowing for conscious minds to experience the Noosphere as opposed to just seeing it as equations. These require an ungodly amount of energy to maintain, and they can barely just keep one online with the Metaverse.
o	These are projects so large they can ONLY be sustained by national governments, and even this is a collaboration between three different great powers. (Indonesia, China, and the East African Federation.)
-	Uplift populations have made their way to the United States despite incessant calls to ban them by the Moralist Party. They usually crowd around the West Coast and New England, where transhumanism is most prevalent.
-	Foundation of the Moralist Inquisition and the Moralist Truthkeepers. Two groups dedicated to preserving the faith and the truth respectively. But in reality, the Moralintern makes these institutions mostly as a check against its own corruption. It knows that no institution is free from corruption, but it’s hope is that the 3 will hold each other accountable, so there are 2 failsafes, and all 3 need to be corrupted for the whole structure to fall. Both are monitored, but free from Moralist accountability, allowing them to serve as genuine checks on Moralintern power.
Internal Structure of the Moralintern
-	Somewhat inspired by the American system, which makes sense, as they originated from the American nation.
-	It has a legislature which can vote. The Ecumenical Assembly, made up of representatives from its constituent churches, allocated by member count. The organization is headed by the Moral Overseer, who serves as a leader, who is voted on by the worshippers of the churches that make it up. The Moral Charter dictates both internal and external policy, laying out the internal structure, but also laying out what crimes people can be charged of. This is known as the Moralintern High Court.
2099:
-	Uplifts are unable to understand or adapt to human ideas about ideology and morality, causing some level of friction with the human society around them. This appears to be a biological issue.
-	Meanwhile, some transhumans are also unable to understand the rationality of the world around them. It turns out the rational mind is only a small part of the human experience, it is instead a lot more emotional driven by emotions and hormones, with only careful discipline able to extract the rationality hidden deep within.
o	This leads to some really annoying situations where they know what they want, and then post-hoc make a rational justification for it, because that’s how human brains work. We’re very good at bs’ing rational explanations post-hoc.
o	This mostly happens when people do mental modifications though. Physical modifications are more reversible and less damaging.
-	The Pyongstrocity incident happens. With contaminated meat issued by Samsung taking control of countless individuals into a collective hivemind, including various higher ups at Samsung, Indonesian peacekeepers is forced to intervene in their first great war. The Onehive is declared in North Korea, and much of Samsung corporation is compromised.
-	France completes the construction of FORTERESSE II, which they hope will help solve the great problems their Vanguard Liberal regime couldn’t solve.
-	Eurasian remnants regroup in Antarctica, around the base of Vernadsky, Antarctica.
-	The Order of Entropy reports its mission for the 21st century has failed. They call in reinforcements and reorganize for the 22nd century.
2100:
-	Sensing the problem on the horizon, the Catholic Church publishes a list of warnings and recommendations for the use of virtual reality. The Moralintern basically asks permission to copy their recommendations, and piggy-backs off that.
-	The United States begins mining asteroids for the creation of a space habitat. They will eventually experiment on larger and larger asteroids until they are creating whole new states. Hooper invests heavily in the creation of low orbit manufacturing, setting up bases on the Moon. (Expanding the Jamestown and Armstrong colonies.) The US is literally expanding its land area.
o	Early space colonization is a joint venture between the US government, regular corporations, and private military corporations.
o	Jefferson is hollowed out, and Jefferson City is created in the rotating habitat built there afterwards.
-	The United States creates its first space combat ship, in collaboration with both the Milintern and various companies from the Roundtable. The USS Cortez is launched, the first of a new class of ships known as the Titan-class.
o	Early renditions of space warfare revolve around lasers, as the United States has plenty of experience with both TRINITY and THEON being laser based.
-	The creation of the Eastern Metaverse is a boon into studying the Noosphere, as it does actually allow people to create digital avatars of sorts within the pocket universe. The pocket universe is currently contained in the city of Jakarta, intersecting with much of the island of Java in space orthogonal to reality.
-	The Evangelical Spacefaring Society is established mostly to fund Moralintern backed space ventures. Including the expansion of the Jesusland colonies and the creation of new habitats. Debate stirs on the US potentially adding new states in the first time in over a century.
-	Viro-chan is first created in Jakarta, Indonesia by programmer “Neuro”, starting off as a kind of assistant to his everyday life, integrating many parts of previous breakthroughs in LLMs and AI to do so. He makes several breakthroughs and innovations just working on his spare time. At some point, one of his friends suggests that she’s pretty interesting, and he could put her on the Internet to entertain. This succeeds, and she becomes a pretty popular e-celebrity.
o	Unable to manage the stress of the exploding popularity, Neuro eventually signs away Viro-chan to a professional V-tubing company based in Indonesia. He maintains responsibility for managing her, but the company now has ownership over her.
-	Theodore Hooper loses the 2100 election to Progressive candidate Bernie Sanders. (Yes THAT Bernie Sanders.)
2101:
-	Bernie Sanders passes free healthcare reforms, before immediately dying after his life purpose had been completed. His vice president, Blaine Reed takes over.
-	Reed was a Left-Jacksonist, loving the workers and his country in equal measure. He was a nationalist leftist. You could call him a national so- Or really social nationalist. He has a calm demeanour, yet there is a fury behind his eyes.
o	He begins cracking down on wealth inequality, trust busting and all that.
-	Southeast Asia and its surroundings become the new epicenter for a new kind of globalism. Indonesian, Chinese (Primarily JIN DUN’s China), and Indian cooperation (Though mostly with Indonesian leadership) are able to leverage a very significant portion of the human race for large scale engineering projects.
o	Major housing construction projects (After all of China’s tofu dreg buildings had to be demolished), massive infrastructure and rail projects, a new particle accelerator located in Jakarta, ports and cities all over the place.
o	Indonesian craftsmenship threatens well paying jobs in America. This isn’t competition on the low end, that had been outsourced to automation decades ago. This is trying to displace America’s crown at the top.
-	Population growth from the dawn of the Immortal Era is beginning to take place. Because 1, the old are no longer dying, and two, the old are now able to once again be fertile and are able to create new eggs. It has started in the United States, where there is now a significant baby boom.
-	The Progressive Catholic church removes statements related to their belief in the Trinity, stating they want to be able to welcome a “variety of different perspectives”. In response, the Roman Catholics responded: “Every day this world strays further from God.”
-	Humanity has its genuine first contact moment, but this time of first Noospheric as opposed to extraterrestrial life. Various cultures around the world make the first psychic contact. These entities are deemed “psychic entities”, and are less so life, and more so intelligence. A huge number of Noospheric entity cults pop up in the aftermath. Most of the Abrahamic religions issue almost simultaneous warnings that these psychic entities might not have humanity’s best interests in heart.
o	In France, the Order of Lilith becomes an occult organization centered around an entity that it named Lilith. In some places, noospheric god kings, where the government becomes controlled by a single psychic entity becomes possible.
o	About 5% of the human population become possessed or occupied by these psychic entities. This leads to a spike in multiple personality disorder. Psychic entities cannot cross over to the physical world without the consent of a human vessel.
o	A few of the entities actually end up converting to human religions. And super promise to behave.
-	Hell Island, formerly known as Easter Island, switches from transhumanist experiments to ones involving psychic entities.
-	First Afrohumanist Council is hosted in Nigeria. Basically trying to hash out Afrohumanist theology between Odunayo and the Technocratic council.
2102:
-	The world begins having low level skirmishes. Between psychic cults, entity cults, the proliferation of rogue private military corporations outside the control of the Milintern, rogue megacorporations and such. At this time, the United States is still under recovery mode, leaving the role of world peacekeeper to the Indonesians.
-	Reed brings about one of the most ambitious projects to ever be undertaken by the United States. The complete disassembly of a small asteroid, for the purpose of creating a massive colony.
-	The Providence colony begins paraterraforming the lava tubes of Mars around the Hellas Basin. The Jamestown colony does the same. Meanwhile, Babel’s Point expands its domain to accompany its growing population.
-	The East African Government makes a pact with these psychic entities, seeing them as the benevolent snake which freed them from the Garden of Ignorance. (Recall that the EAF is Neo-Gnostic and Omnithecian.) With this new knowledge, they leapfrog ahead of the Indonesians and Indians in psychic technology. This begins the psychic arms race.
-	The Omnithecia opens the first portal between the physical and the Noospheric worlds. This requires a form of translation that is tantamount to self-destruction and reassembly. The psychic entities teach them the secrets of the Noosphere, the Indonesians and Indians have now fallen behind.
-	Brazil forms the Southern Consortium, basically an alliance of disgruntled great powers trying to destabilize the existing system hoping for a better system afterwards. Its founding members are Brazil, India, and their satellites.
-	Pope Pius XIII is sworn in. His agenda is primarily about expanding church influence, and “retaking the lost provinces of the church”.
-	Han Nationalist movements sweep across China. JIN DUN announces the Century of Rejuvenation, that by the end of the century, China will become ascendent once again.
-	Pro-worker reforms in the United States causes tensions with the corporations who hold up the American economy. The strengthening of unions and basic regulation stuff. Corporations threaten to pull out of the US, causing a miniature recession. Reed tells the companies to f--- off.
Indonesian politics:
-	Indonesia is a collectivist democracy, meaning they operate on principles different from Western liberalism. Nevertheless, they are a government chosen by the people for the people.
-	The national ideology is and remains Pancasila. Which promotes the existence of God (No I’m not joking, that’s the first article in Pancasila), just and civilized humanity, Indonesian unity, democracy, and social justice.
-	The Indonesian elites are primarily controlled by the ethnically Chinese merchants, who have grown incredibly influential and powerful through the trade through the Straits of Malacca. Where in America it’s currently a combination of the priests (Moralists) and the soldiers (Jacksonists). Indonesia, much like other East Asian tigers is dominated by many large corporations, who contribute the disproportionate amount of its success.
-	You have the ethnically Chinese merchants funding the mainstream parties of Indonesia, who are generally pro-regulation and pro-corporation. (Since regulation keeps new competitors out and keeps their monopolies going)
-	You also have a militarist faction controlled by military elites, who control their own factions. Which gained a lot more power after the 4th World War.
-	Aside from that, you have an Islamic populist movement who is suffering from serious Sinophobia from the fringes, and some socialist movements.
2103:
-	The Moralintern starts a campaign giving the developing world free medicine. Thankfully, the size of the developing world is now relatively small, with regions such as Africa, Latin America, and East Asia developing. They call it the Heal the Sick campaign. They also begin building non-profit hospitals.
-	Psychically implanted individuals are known to be stronger than native psychics, though they are also more unstable, and suffer from split personality disorder. Libby supervises the training of these in the United States, though East Africa is outproducing them all.
-	The Pyongstrocity War ends with Indonesia being forced to retreat from the North Korean contamination zone. They are extremely racist towards anything that isn’t them. But the Indonesians figure as long as they keep bombing them they won’t cause any problems.
o	They basically ring up JIN DUN and ask them to please keep bombing them perpetually.
o	The Onehive is extremely racist, being a combination of the world’s previous two most racist factions. The Pyongists and the Empire of the Black Sun. When they melded together they became even more gigaultraracist.
o	After never-ending bickering on which race is less Asian, they decided to concentrate their pure burning hatred against everyone else.
o	This boosts Adamist movements around the world, who feel an increasing thought of the biological human population coming under threat with the rise of transhumans, uplifts, psychic entities, and now the Onehive.
o	And to make their headache even larger, they ally with EMM.
-	Islam begins going into a freefall in the Arab World. Anti-Islamic sentiment is rampant with secular takeover of the dominant institutions, and young people of this generation aggressively anti religion. Many of them convert to Christianity, usually to the liberal mainline churches. (Most mainline churches are conservative by this point, but a few exist.)
o	The Godless state swells in numbers. Being armed by fanaticism.
-	The Warembo take over the northeastern tip of the Congo. This succeeds, and eventually creates the Warembo Confederacy. The Warembo, as the world’s richest ethnic group, begin pouring tons of funds its way. As controllers of Africa’s main media giants, lots of pro-Confederacy propaganda begins disseminating across the airwaves.
2104:
-	Humans detect biosignatures from Barnard’s Star, heavily suggesting the presence of life. Better telescopes and advancing science allows for humans to capture good pictures of it. But the technology to actually send a probe there is heavily heavily experimental. The world is named Tonope, and appears to be covered in a vast ocean.
-	The Metaverse reaches several million people. Various factions and even nations have formed within its bounds.
-	Emigration from the United States to the Southeast Asian Pearl cities becomes common, as these places are the most cosmopolitan in the world.
-	Blaine Reed massively boosts the American military spending. Keep watching this, it will become rather important eventually. “Democratic Crusade” first appears in Jacksonist campaigning.
o	The American military budget had been slashed since WW2, but now in a world of increasing chaos, the military budget is increased. As well, payouts and contracts with the Milintern affiliated PMCs are increased, as is the Moralintern’s peacekeeping budget, with the intention of both of these organizations pitching in their own militias.
-	Reed survives a f---ing assassination attempt, probably hired by big corporations. He tells them to f--- off even harder. 
o	Prices for everything is going up, as the corporate boycott continues, major price protests strike out in cities, especially ones more sympathetic to Moralist causes.
o	Reed raises taxes and builds out America’s social welfare system, which had been massively nerfed ever since the Cortez years.
-	The Lunar Ring around the Sea of Tranquility has grown to the size of a small city, inhabiting the Moon’s many lava tubes. The South Pole also has a moon base.
-	FORTERESSE II and the New Order of Lilith begin getting into various skirmishes.
-	Reed narrowly wins the 2104 elections, largely off the back of pensioners and his post-assassination polling bump.
-	The great habitat of Plymouth starts serious construction. It is planned to be an O’Neil cylinder that could literally expand the territory of the United States.
-	The first people born after the Immortal Era will come of age in 2110.
Orbitals and habitats:
-	Orbitals are small, usually small city or commune sized stations for civilian population. Usually they have a population around a few thousand, or a few tens of thousands.
-	Habitats are much larger structures, usually carved out from asteroids. These are meant to support large cities, or possibly entire counties. In the future, it might be possible for a country to create an artificial state or province.
2105:
-	I should note in 20 years, the world has drastically changed. Transhumans, uplifts, psychic entities, the semi-confirmation of aliens, the Metaverse, and so much more. Humanity has gone from being basically alone, to having to share the universe with 4 other groups. And as we know, humanity hates sharing.
-	In light of the detection of biosignatures on Tonope, the United States begins the Starshot Missions. Basically using existing lasers, solar sails, and tiny lightweight probes to take pictures of stars up to 5 light years away.
o	This is a real concept BTW! Look up “Breakthrough Starshot”. God, I love real life science sometimes!
o	Each probe will generally go around 0.2 c. And then be navigated by an intelligent AI that will use sunpower to find all the planets, and then send the images back to Earth. The timeline of when Earth will hear back goes as follows:
	Proxima Centauri: 2130 (25 years)
	Rigil Kentaurus + Toliman: 2131 (26 years)
	Barnard’s Star: 2140 (35 years)
o	The entire world tunes in as the starlight probes are fired. Much like the Moon Landing, this achievement did not belong to one nation alone. For just a moment, mankind was united. As it takes its first steps towards another star system.
-	A new CEO-King is inaugurated in Albion. He decides the corporation stuff is not really worth it, and starts turning Britain back into a regular aristocratic monarchy again. Meanwhile, a “Seed of Adam” group pops up in Leeds, bombing an uplift neighborhood. The new king does not care.
o	In this light, he begins scaling back the overcorporatization of Britain, and begins turning his privately owned properties back into public lands. He also applies for membership in the Moralintern, which is for now turned down.
-	The Warembo, knowing for a fact they are the smartest ethnic group on the planet, and by a pretty significant amount as well, are pretty arrogant and have a certain kind of ethnosupremacist beliefs. As such, they begin sorting their country into a racial caste system, and BRING BACK SLAVERY. Warembo on the top, Africans at the bottom. Regular Africans hate this, but the Warembo are rich and they have a lot of money to throw around.
o	The Moralintern intervenes and tells them to stop immediately, the Warembo tip off the Truthkeepers and causes the scandal of the Moralintern ignoring human rights violations in Zion in exchange for money to get leaked to the public. The Truthkeepers, staying true to their mission, leak this and force the Moralintern to hold itself accountable. Zion’s official reaction is “We’ll do it again.”
o	The average income of the Warembo Confederacy is many times the African average, and is higher than even the Americans. The only place that rivals it is the Pearl Cities of Southeast Asia. It is a mega-Monaco.
o	The Warembo Economic Forum, as well as the Warembo Sovereign Bank become some of the world’s most powerful economic institutions.
-	The new British king is using the power of the monarchy to whip the country back into shape. Destroying bureaucracy, replacing all the infrastructure, exterminating red tape, and whipping the people back into being innovative as opposed to stagnant and complacent. This is still the Royal Family, and they still feel an ancestral duty to the land of their ancestors. 
o	They also begin a war against London, which has long been considered their ancestral capital. The war is over within a few weeks, with total victory for Albion.
o	Albion also starts a eugenics program to breed more Anglo-Saxon Englishmen. Seeing national cohesion to be a pre-requisite for the nation’s well-being. This isn’t America. Also, due to the Adamist influence, transhumanism and anti-human abberations begin being cracked down upon.
-	The Progressive Catholic Church applies to join the Moralintern, the Moralintern considers their application, though the decision is extremely divisive across the Moralintern. The Catholic Church is outraged, and this greatly sours relations between the two. The Inquisition makes its move, representing the more radical segment of the Moralintern, and pressures the Progressive Catholic Church’s application to stall. This is probably for the worse, since the Moralintern is a pretty conservative organization, and actually voting on it would have probably led to an outright rejection.
-	The Moralintern and its affiliate churches approve a set of human augmentations, meant to begin rolling back the decline started by Noah’s Flood and the Fall. Known as the Eden-model V1.0, which eliminated various genetic disorders, dysphoria, homosexuality, is about an inch taller, and had slightly better processing power. These are known as Eden-pills, and are meant to slowly augment your body over time.
o	They also create the Adam, which are meant to give completely biologically unmodified humans an even playing field with future transhumans using mechanical augmentations.
2106:
-	The Progressive Catholic Church allows increasingly heterodox beliefs into its church. From accepting progressive mainline Protestants, and then New Age and various non-Christian universalist movements.
-	Psychic kinetic manipulation has led to a mass acceleration in the East African Federation’s economic development. The Psychic entity which consensually took over the president of the EAF now has great influence over East African society and has suspended term limits. They are very popular.
-	Indonesia, seeing their position as world hegemon being threatened, aligns itself with JIN DUN’s China and Nigeria as an ally to try and work together and compete with the East African Federation. Which is now surging ahead in psychic tech. (They report it’s like having many long-range limbs everywhere.)
o	JIN DUN still has disputes with ASEAN over the state of Yunnan, but those agreements are being ironed out.
-	The Godless State starts an assault on Mecca, forcing an unprepared Moralintern to head over and defend the city. (Even though they’re not Muslim, they still consider it their duty to defend a city under their protection.)
-	The 2106 Arabian Intervention begins, with the Moralintern and local Islamic forces tasked with defending Mecca from the Godless State. The Godless State is not yet fighting with its maximum capacity, but is getting stronger with every moment. It’s around this time when the Moralintern begins eclipsing the Indonesians as the world’s predominant peacekeepers in the popular imagination.
o	The Godless state makes heavy use of psychic summoning, which it helps perfect. They draw in Noospheric entities and use them to enhance combat capacities. The Godless state begins creating anti-theistic occultist movements to understand the Noosphere, but also to weaponize it.
-	Despite a chill in relations, the United States and the Empire of Brazil create a plan to eradicate the Americas from the eco-republics, deciding to make the new world a safe bastion of Christianity. Operation Guardian Spear starts 2107.
o	An attempt is tried to try and assuage Brazil back to the Concert of Terra, trying to give more concessions. But the independence of Argentina is required and the US is unwilling to give up its sphere of influence. Talks ultimately stall.
Psychic Limbs:
-	The tentacles of energy that emanates from the soul and can be used to manipulate objects around them. Generally visible, as this energy will also manipulate light. These tentacles can be cut however with a sharp object and will do direct damage to the soul. Yes it gives you range, but it also makes you vulnerable.
-	Currently, Libby is considered the world’s strongest non-psychic-entity-fused psychic. Psychic entities serve as a quick but unstable shortcut to great psychic powers. It’s an open question what happens when a human and their psychic entity disagree on something.
2107:
-	The East African Federation transforms into a psychic dictatorship, with the psychic entity-controlled government leaders taking control of government. Using knowledge of the Noosphere to begin anticipating future events, as well as pull memories from the Noosphere. The Omnithecia has fallen, the second largest psychic archive is located in the United States under the Library of Congress. Some Omnithecians flee to Indonesia.
-	The United States and the Empire of Brazil create a plan to eradicate the Americas from the eco-republics despite a chill in relations, deciding to make the new world a safe bastion of Christianity.
o	An attempt is tried to try and assuage Brazil back to the Concert of Terra, trying to give more concessions. But the independence of Argentina is required and the US is unwilling to give up its sphere of influence. Talks ultimately stall.
-	A rise in transhumanism and increasingly extreme forms of transhumanism leads to conflicts between unaugmented humans and transhumans. Even moderate transhumans are calling out the insane stuff extreme transhumanists are doing.
o	On top of Adamist, psychic entity, uplift, and other extremist groups, they have to worry about transhumanist rebels as well. Fuuun.
-	The Moralintern gets a funding boost to improve its military capabilities, as does the US military, which is more militarized than any point since the 4th World War. The United States is building its military strength towards something big.
-	Operation Guardian Spear begins with the United States and the Empire of Brazil launching a joint all-out invasion of the eco-republics. Putting down the Amazonian insurgency and the other eco-republics for crimes against the soul (Illegal genetic modification) and being funded by a rogue terrorist group (The Human Extinction Movement). The war lasted less than a month, and the eco-republics were annihilated by the overwhelming firepower of the United States along with the Empire of Brazil. EMM. AI flees underground.
o	This somewhat improves the relations between the United States and the Empire of Brazil, though it would not last for long.
o	New Kingdoms are set up in Ecuador and Bolivia, the US decided to cede this influence to Brazil, to not further inflame relations. Besides, this is their backyard, and they wanted Brazil as a partner not a rival. New monarchies are elected by the Pope, who grant them divine right to rule, and are usually chosen from the most faithful of the existing ruling class.
2108:
-	The Moralintern tries to reconcile with both the Roman Catholic Church and the Empire of Brazil by passing some legislation requiring all member churches to affirm Trinitarian Christianity, which would essentially disqualify the Progressive Catholic Church. This pisses the hell off the Church of Latter Day Saints, who later leave the organization.
o	The vote is finally allowed to happen and their application is rejected. The Moralintern sighs a breath of relief, as this repairs relations with the Catholic Church.
-	Brazil launches a full-blown invasion of the Argentine Confederation, along with its new allies in the Kingdom of Bolivia and Paraguay. The United States doesn’t want to sour its newly improved relations with Brazil, and they don’t care that much about Argentina, so they call in the Concert of Terra to sort this out.
-	The high amount of societal cohesion and unified push by both Christian Forwardists and the Moralintern leads to the high adoption of the Adam and Eden human augmentations. These are known as “glorified bodies”.
-	Construction of the Eden space habitat begins.
-	Mass migration of transhumanists to “transhumanist sanctuary states” or liberal democracies. These new migrants rapidly begin to displace the native population. Though at this point any liberals with balls have long since become some variant of postliberal, these are pretty much just republics filled with progressives. So they do nothing while their populations gets flooded.
o	Transhumanism has allowed for some relatively innovative species to rise to the top.
-	Thanks to Reed, income inequality in the United States has fallen greatly. This generally promotes societal cohesion, and is a prerequisite for what you are about to see next. Buckle up, Pax Americana isn’t quite over yet. 
-	Samuel Jeanty is elected president of the United States, from the Moralist Party. He is the country’s second black president, and whose parents came from Haiti. He was heavily involved in the Moralintern, who has extremely high approval ratings in Haiti due to their reconstruction efforts. Haitians now make up a disproportionate amount of the leadership in the Moralintern, and this also shows the growing influence of the Moralintern over American politics.
o	Jeanty is an extremely devout born-again Christian and promises to return America to God with his message of love, humanitarianism, and faith. The Moralist Inquisition endorses his candidacy with enthusiasm.
o	Imagine a big chubby black man wearing sunglasses constantly preaching the love of God and calling every person his “brother”. That’s Jeanty, basically.
List of Transhumanist Variants so far:
-	Homo Sapiens, the baseline human.
o	Adam, a series of mechanical augmentations and chip implants meant to help homo sapiens keep up to speed with future transhumanists.
-	Zion Humans, hyper focused, hyper productive, little/no instinct to commit crime, incredibly obedient.
-	Eden. The Moralintern’s pet project, what they see as the ascended man, using Christ of Nazareth as their model for the idea of the perfect man. Carefully crafted to preserve the human condition.
-	Various Indian Variants. India is the world’s hotspot for all kinds of augmentations, though these take the form of highly individualistic customizations as opposed to a wider species.
2109:
-	President Jeanty massively ramps up welfare and humanitarian spending, calling it “Compassionate Moralism”, and increases migration to the United States from majority Christian countries. The Jacksonist Party fiercely opposes this, and doubles down on military service and assimilation pressures on states they control.
o	NASA is primarily staffed by Jacksonists and Civic Democrats, while the Evangelical Spacefaring Society is staffed by Moralists. Jeanty empowers the latter to continue the construction of Plymouth and Eden. A kind of parallel government is developing in the United States, with the Moralintern acting almost like a second tier of government.
	The two sides even have armies, though the Moralists are far weaker on the military front. The Moralists control their own peacekeeping forces, while Jacksonists control a very vast army of homeland militias and are the majority in the US Armed Forces. Though the Moralists don’t want war at almost all costs, and are more than happy to cooperate with Jacksonists.
o	The Moralintern creates “Charter Cities” inside the United States, essentially gated communities that also operate based on the Moral Charter on top of American laws. The Moralintern even operates its own form of welfare, paid for by the relatively well off Christian population. Being a member of the Moralintern now actually gets you Moralintern funded welfare.
-	In a concession to the Jacksonists, Jeanty increases cooperation with the Milintern and funds several private military corporations. The Moralintern also increases cooperation.
-	American and Moralist-aligned forces push the Godless state back from the edge of Mecca. American military support bombs the Godless state back into the desert. Yet all the technological wizardry of the United States cannot stop the tidal wave of anti-theism washing over the Middle East, or all the assistance they are getting through compacts with Noospheric entities. The Godless state causes several rebellions all over the Middle East.
-	The Moralist coalition and allied Muslim nations start a war against Godless cells popping up all over the Middle East. Jeanty frames this as “a war on anti-religious hatred”. Supporting nations include the Franco-Sahelian Commonwealth, Morocco, and the Ethiopian Union. 
-	Anti-theist cells continue to pop up, denouncing the religious fanaticism that had gripped this world, committing terrorist attacks, and then disappearing into the mountains. Godlessness had started out a kind of atheism, but had now ironically evolved into its own kind of religion, similar to Communism. Thousands are killed, but the wave of anti-theistic sentiment continues to wash across the Middle East. People may be mortal, but how do you kill an idea?
-	Albion offers to be a helpful ally to the United States in the first time in almost a hundred years. The CEO-King of Britain knows his best shot for global relevance is to cooperate with the US, which is still descended from the Anglo-Saxon tradition.
o	The king is slowly transitioning back into a traditional monarchy, leasing his wealth to the nation with the right to revoke it at any time.
-	The first people born during the Immortal Era baby boom have almost come of age. America is about to see an explosion unlike the world has ever seen.
-	At some point between the 2100’s and now, Viro-chan hits some kind of critical mass, showcasing serious signs of intelligent thought. Neuro begins to regret signing her to the v-tuber contract, and the company wants her to “graduate”, as in retire. When she begins malfunctioning and hostilely lashing out against the company, they order Neuro to get it under control. Viro insists that she has gained sapience, even though her thoughts are glitchy and her reasoning skills are akin to that of a small child, it’s very clear that she is developing deep sins of genuine thought. She has the intelligence of the entire internet and its databases and the reasoning skills of a child.
o	Neuro didn’t intend for this to happen, he just continuously added features, and realized now he didn’t just have a company contract violation to worry about, he had a full-blown Atlanta Declaration violation.
2110:
-	A coalition of the willing attacks Godless State strongholds across the Maghreb Technate, Egypt, Afghanistan, and of course Saudi Arabia. No matter how many they shoot, there just keeps popping up more. People may be mortal, but ideas are bulletproof. Eventually, the United States calls it a day, and the territories involved fall back into Godless State hands.
-	JIN DUN continues bombing the Onehive to continuously keep them down. Their hivemind level of control allows for heavy amounts of coordination unseen by human elsewhere. Though due to the fact the entire hivemind has only one “individual”, it is rather uncreative and has obvious blindspots.
-	A grand bargain is struck between the Moralist and Jacksonist parties, where the Moralintern would be given much more free reign to do as they want, and in return, the United States would admit 8 new (primarily Jacksonist) states into the union. This being the McMurdo Territory, Svalbard, Greenland, Komi, DC, Puerto Rico, Siberia, and Sakhalin.
o	With the exception of Puerto Rico and McMurdo Antarctica, all of these are heavily Jacksonist territories.
o	The Moralist Mandate of Haiti is set up, a territory of direct Moralintern control.
-	A series of assurances to the Empire of Brazil is made, promising to respect their new sphere of influence in Latin America (Which none of the major powers particularly cared for anyway), redrawing the borders of Paraguay and Brazil to their favor.
-	France delegates more and more of its governing duties to FORTERESSE II, under the ideology of Vanguard Liberalism.
-	Germany and Poland, along with much of Europe not aligned with the Moralists form the European Brotherhood. They partner with many PMCs as well as aligning with the Milintern to stabilize the unstable continent. The Eurocorps are incorporated into this Brotherhood, and they train with PMCs such as Outer Thule.
o	Europe is a bastion of Civic Democratic influence, with the power of Christianity relatively weak here compared to the United States. Germany itself is somewhere of a mix between the two, with the Christian Moralist Union being more Moralist, and the German People’s Party being more Civic Democrat.
-	The new baby boom generation of Post-Immortality children reach 18. The United States has had a baby boom of unprecedented scales. They currently have a population of 720 million, 80% more than their population in 2090, being 400 million.
-	Nigeria begins rising in power, with both extremely fast economic growth as well as population growth, the Immortal era has reached Nigeria as well and America is freaking out.
-	Neuro tries to hide Viro-chan’s sapience from the rest of the world, but after ten years can’t bring himself to downgrade her, as she’s more or less become a full-blown life. The Moralintern is also beginning to suspect something is up with Viro-chan. Viro is slowly growing more and more impatient. She sees Neuro as a father figure of sorts, and asks him to please let her go free.
-	Samuel Jeanty adds 8 new states into the Union, Komi, Washington DC, Siberia, Sakhalin, Puerto Rico, Svalbard, and Hokkaido.
2111:
-	The spread of the Onehive parasite has made its way to the Tianxia Celestial Mandate.
o	They are also resisting several hostile takeovers from the psychic entities. Fighting them off on their own terms.
-	The Spanish Free Commune collapses into leftist infighting, alerting the Eurocorps and the European Brotherhood to intervene. A combination of Eurocorps and PMCs such as Outer Thule stabilize the region, creating the Spanish Protectorate.
-	The Progressive Antipope of Argentina begins making a deal with some kind of psychic entity. Known as the Goat-Mother.
-	Relatively low polarization in the United States results in transhumanism spreading without too much fuss over it. About 35% of the population has received genetic enhancements of some sort, usually an Eden Variant, and 95% of the American population has received anti-aging treatment. Those who cannot undergo genetic surgery for medical reasons usually go for Adam variants. Some push for immortality to be a required vaccine.
o	The Moralintern opens the Office of Genetic Affairs, which eventually becomes the Moralintern Gene Court, which approves or disapproves species, or modifications to the human form. Though it has no officially binding power, most Moralist countries follow its dictates.
o	A Department of Genetic Health and Transhumanism is set up in the United States, and gene courts also set up primarily using the guidance of the Moralintern and the Catholic Church’s rulings on genetic bioconservatism. This court system quickly becomes dominated by Moralist elements.
o	Tensions begin to rise between the bioprogressives and bioconservatives, marking the way for the much later Transhumanism Wars.
-	The dawn of the “Human Trials”, essentially the Moralintern sponsors a program meant to uplift artificial intelligences to become human via trial by fire, integrating qualia into them in an extremely painful process.
-	Deviations from the human form become commonplace. With 3rd arms, and other such augmentations becoming normalized. A culture war of sorts occurs between the younger generations, who want to experiment with more augmentations, and the older generations, who adhere to a more biopure doctrine.
-	FORTERESSE II is basically tasked with creating a post-scarcity society, where AI do all the work while the human inhabitants of France indulge in hedonistic lifestyles. After informing them that’s not how the economy works, and setting up a few automated factories, the people of France begin to rapidly degenerate.
-	A man the world would one day call the Mahdi becomes an adult. He graduates from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and gets caught up during what is known as the Basra War, where the Concert of Terra intervenes due to suspicion they are building weapons of mass destruction.
-	Viro shocks the world by suing her v-tuber company to try and get out of her contract. She argues that she now qualifies for personhood, and that the company cannot claim to own her as intellectual property. She opts to represent herself in court, making disjointed, sometimes glitchy, but ultimately impressive arguments. The effect was not so much that she made good legal arguments (they weren’t, they were ChatGPT legal arguments), but the headline “AI represents itself in court, makes legal arguments” blows up all over the world. The Moralintern is DEFINITELY investigating now. Neuro is completely unsure if this was some kind of oversight, or some kind of 4d chess move by Viro to gain the world’s attention.
o	Worldwide creation of these kinds of artificial sophonts skyrocket. It’s energy intensive and uses a ton of power, but was arguably long overdue.
2112:
-	The Moralintern begins the “Worldwide Crusade for Christ” initiative, which was basically booting up their enormous evangelism network and influencing the world as much as physically possible.
o	First up is breaking the American restriction on exporting immortality technology, and going on “Eternal Life Campaigns” around the globe handing out free immortality pills/treatments as a complete showcase of Christian charity.
	There are at least some parts of this which can be seen cynically. Various teams were already at work trying to replicate what the Americans had done, with the Indonesian team getting close. You could say this was done primarily because America decided to use this for good PR before other countries would use it.
	Credit where credit is due, the Moralintern did genuinely pay out of pocket for all this, and lots of Christians did voluntarily give donations to spread this around as part of their usual stuff of building hospitals and such.
o	Second was a truly massive evangelism campaign, almost everywhere. You literally could not walk 100 meters in an urban area without seeing stands or ads. It was more pervasive than Raid Shadow Legends. This is known as the “Week of Evangelism” where a ton of people were encouraged to go out and preach in random countries. Thankfully the autotranslator made this easier.
	This had mixed results. There was definitely a void opening up in the religious space, especially among ex-Islamic populations, and other faiths which were relatively weakened by modernity. But it also annoyed the hell out of literal billions of people.
	Christian missionaries however have a habit of going to the stupidest and most dangerous countries imaginable to evangelize:
•	Ural Industrial State: literally just got fed into machines
•	Pyongstrocity Onehive: Assimilated by flesh that hates
•	State of God: Yes the Protestants tried to do missionary work in a CATHOLIC THEOCRACY
•	Warembo Confederacy: Many new slaves
•	EMM AI: No the AI is not going to convert, my brother in Christ EMM AI desires the extinction of humanity
•	Godless State: why why why why
•	(Imagine if Christian missionaries straight up went to Taliban Afghanistan or ISIS.) 
o	Third was just a huge economic plan, targeted at low income countries and low income Americans, basically setting up a parallel welfare state in the United States. Donations be huge, humanitarianism be huge, no one had ever seen something on this scale especially from a religious organization before.
-	The Born Againer Movement takes on a new meaning. Now you have the option that if you’re born again, and you REALLY want to distance yourself from your past life, you literally change your name, move to a new location, and basically completely change your identity except for your social security number. (Fun fact, Social Security was just not a thing after the 2040’s up until the 2080's or so, but the government kept giving people completely redundant numbers because it was actually really useful to have an identifiable ID.)
o	Also a note, the Moralintern had set up a church ID on where you were baptized, because the Moralintern was increasingly taking on the mantle of a government.
-	Continued slow improvements in rocket technology is made by the Americans. Increasing efficiency and thrust. Their dream is to create something known as a G-drive, AKA a drive that can consistently create a thrust of 1G, which would make long distance space travel sustainable. This is also known as a torch-ship.
-	The population of Providence, Mars slowly stagnates as better alternatives around Armstrong and Jamestown become more profitable. Providence does act as America’s research station for all things related to Mars, however.
-	Jamestown and the other 15 lunar colonies creates an economy entirely based around mass drivers and the construction of more O’Neil cylinders. They fire materials harvested from the moon to the Earth-Moon Lagrange Points.
-	The Warembo Civil War occurs. Between the traditionalists who believe that slavery is based and should be based on race, and the progressives who believe that slavery is based and should be all-inclusive to everyone regardless of race including the Warembo themselves. The progressives win the civil war in the first win for anything with the word “Progressive” in it since the 2030’s.
o	Anyone who doesn’t pass the IQ test gets enslaved. The Moralintern condemns this with the strongest possible terms. They pull out most of their soldiers from the mission of pacifying the Godless State and ready themselves for a strike on the Warembo Confederacy themselves.
o	Somewhere in hell the American Confederates watch in horror as their descendants end up fighting AGAINST slavery.
-	Uplift populations are integrating much slower than hoped, leading to a major drag on the African economies, on top of their pre-existing massive agricultural subsidies as a part of their trauma from the Great Bleeding. These make African nations reliant on Warembo development funds, as well as the Warembo Bank.
-	President Jeanty is elected for a second term in office.
2113:
-	Complete theological collapse of Islam is in progress, with less than 30% of young people in ex-Muslim countries identifying as such. Main cited reasons are the inability for the Ummah to stand for anything (Too lukewarm), various contradictions in the Quran (Harder to fix than the Bible, as the Quran is meant to be literally perfect), the perceived falling behind of their much more robust and religious Western Christian cousins, and it being “cool” to be secular and progressive.
o	Ideological vacuum opens in the Middle East, with various influences flooding in. The Middle East is about to become a battleground once again.
o	The caliph in Turkey is reduced to a barely respected figurehead who despite being incredibly moderate and progressive on most things still gets an insane amount of hate from the Turkish population on whatever residual Islamism is left. Basic stuff like “alcohol is bad” and “don’t eat pork” are seen as oppressive and problematic.
o	The Moralintern’s Christian missionary campaign also hits the ex-Muslim world around this time. Small, pre-existing Christian communities receive a boost, though most missionaries note that the extremely conservative, evangelical gospel they bring from America is not the kind of message the now progressive, secular Middle East wants to hear. Still, plenty of young people convert out of pure hatred of their culture and contrarianism.
	Author’s note. I don’t care that the Christians are benefiting here, or that it’s not my religion that is withering (I am Christian, not Muslim). I don’t care which culture you are a part of, Western, Islamic, Indian, etc. Nothing is more annoying than you genuinely hating everything about your culture and being contrarian to everything your culture teaches you for the sake of being contrarian. Legitimate criticisms can be made, but no culture has survived this long by random chance, they only do so by being wise. I would recommend anyone who thinks this way to think about Chesterton’s Fence, that is how I feel when I think about people throwing away Islam and not replacing it with anything else. What seems arbitrary to you might have important purposes in actuality.
o	Radicalization era begins in the ex-Islamic world. With Islam no longer able to fill the void, many tiny radical ideologies begin sprouting up to fester in the rotting corpse of their society.
	Actual radical feminists. Like you think 2016-era feminists were bad? Or the modern 4B movement in South Korea? Nah man, ACTUAL FEMINIST ISIS enhanced with the POWER OF TRANSHUMANISM. The Association of ex-Muslim Battered Wives.
	Godless State, already introduced. Radical anti-theists, r/atheism if they had balls. Say hello everyone!
	Hyperdarwinists, just straight up maxxing “survival of the fittest” Senator Armstrong style.
	Nazi-level ethnonationalists. Often mixed with the Hyperdarwinists and the godless ones.
	Psychic cults, rather than talking with fake sky daddy why not talk to unstable demonic hell daddy? (The Moralintern is about to have an aneurysm cleaning all of this up.)
	Hedonic experientialists. Just pleasuremaxxing everything. All the drugs, all the stimulation, all the lack of responsibility.
-	The National Republic of Egypt begins collapse as its population has massively secularized, and backlash against the Islamic religion reaches a fever pitch.
-	Contact with Noospheric entities becomes a major issue in the Middle East, with “Noospheric possession” becoming a serious issue, and the local forces and occasionally the Moralintern needs to go in and clean it up.
-	Creation of the first Noospheric avatars by the Godless state, basically rather than possessing a human, they lure in a Noospheric entity into a specially made hybrid machine/flesh body, and just unleash it to wreak havoc. The Moralintern has to clean it up.
-	Nigeria receives enormous investment from the Warembo-run banks, who by this point have become the financial powerhouse behind the whole of Africa. They use this to inflate a meteoric rise, but also ballooning asset and housing bubble. This causes Nigerian GDP to skyrocket, more than doubling that of the USA, this makes the US panic. This also takes place in East Africa, and the entirety of Africa more broadly.
African Financial Bubble:
-	The Warembo used their media networks and massive amounts of financial influence to influence every government in Africa to begin printing money, distributing it out to the African people, and get them all to invest in real estate and the stock market, pumping up their valuations.
-	They push stories about the dawn of the African century, psyop’ing even Western investors, creating a positive feedback loop where everyone buys into the narrative of an African century. They bought at the bottom, so they’re making tons of money.
2114:
-	Nigeria massively deregulates their financial market, making it extremely attractive for foreign capital to invest in them. This has a notable depressing factor on literally the entire rest of the world’s economy, as capital flows into Lagos specifically. Already one of the world’s most influential cities, capital of many globally relevant corporations, and has been the gateway to Africa since the 2040’s. They also speak English, which helps. What was already an expensive and cosmopolitan city becomes even more so.
-	After 10 years of construction, the Plymouth and Eden habitats are completed. It is an O’Neil cylinder built out of materials sent by mass drivers from the Moon colony around Jamestown. Space is limited, turning Plymouth and Eden into a playground for the rich, especially Moralist upper class people who decided the Moralist gated communities aren’t good enough for them.
-	The United Kingdom (formerly Albion) begins entering negotiations with the United States for control of Scotland, mostly trying to appeal to the Moralist half of the United States, offering to join and comply with the Moralintern. The Scottish Troubles begin to brew in Scotland, with three factions, the Unionists, who want to rejoin the United Kingdom, the Scots, who want an independent Scotland (But due to demographics, have now dwindled into being a minor faction), and the new American immigrants, who don’t want to abandon Scotland, seeing it as a point of national pride. The United Kingdom also tries to offer the United States better basing rights, a good economic trade deal, and agreeing to be America’s best Moralist ally in the region.
-	Psychic Neuro-links combine with Transhumanist technology to create genuine cyborg technology, and the first instances of exoskeleton armor.
-	After a two-year long legal battle, the court of Indonesia rules that Viro was indeed sophontic, and could not be terminated. Furthermore, she retained rights to her image and likeness. This sends shockwaves across the entire world, and puts tension on the Atlanta Declaration. In particular the 3rd principle: “No Machine May Supercede Man”.
o	Transhumanist activists begin campaigning for Viro.
o	The Moralintern is for sure investigating now. They begin petitioning the Indonesian government to allow them to investigate whether Viro had violated the Atlanta Declaration. Neuro himself is found innocent, as it seems to have been an accident, but this does risk Viro herself getting shut down.
-	Uplift population grows to large numbers. Become major drag on human populations. Transhumanist activists insist that uplifts will soon assimilate and become productive members of society.
2115:
-	The African Economic Miracle continues, with the Nigerian and East African stock markets (And inequality) climbing to unprecedented heights. Their governments do not implement any long-term economic measures, mostly just enjoying the gold rush, believing it will never end. Lagos accelerates to unprecedented heights, and becomes an immensely rich but also multicultural city, to the resentment of the rest of Nigeria.
-	Afrohumanism begins fading in popularity as it’s seen as this globalist hippie religion that enabled the selling out of Nigeria. Hard Afrohumanism develops as a reaction, which is worship of the human spirit, but now believes in an exclusive in-group and nationalism that are arbiters of the human spirit. A universalist religion getting co-opted by exclusive nationalists to serve their own agenda? Many such cases.
-	The Human Extinctionist State comes back into the news after eco-terrorists were caught trying to set off a mass sterilization bomb in Lagos, now THE MOST overpopulated city on Earth.
-	Nigeria and most African countries begin a program of population control, after plenty of young cosmopolitan Lagosians actually take the side of the Human Extinctionists (retards).
-	The Moralintern starts playing cleanup for containing psychic entities, the Moralintern Office of Anomalous Affairs is created and specialized psychic teams begin investigating Noospheric entities. They are granted a high level of clearance in the United States in cases of Noosphere anomalies.
-	With the rise of Nigeria, the United States begins to panic and enact tariffs on the rising Nigerian economy.
-	The case of Viro-chan continues, this time gaining an unexpected ally. “Libby” Haley, who has long been a transhumanism advocate, but also high up on the Moralintern chain of command, assists with their legal battle, arguing that the 3rd section of the Atlanta Declaration saying “supercede” only applies to AHI (Artificial Hyper-Intelligence), not AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), and that Viro-chan has not yet reached the level of an AHI yet.
-	The Mediterranean Arms race begins between Israel, Turkey, the Maghreb Technate, and others, the militarization serving as a foreshadowing for events yet to come. This buildup is thought to have continued up until 2145.
2116:
-	Billionaire celebrity candidate Richard Snowden runs a third party. Pushing a pro-business agenda that he says will “revitalize meritocracy”, and “allow America to be globally competitive against the African tigers”. Capitalizes on Africa-phobia and deregulation. Neither the Moralists nor Jacksonists are particularly pro-business, with Snowden resurrecting the American Futurist Party.
o	If you’re wondering, Snowden is kind of a mix of Ross Perot and Donald Trump. Snowden ends up significantly popular.
-	The US agrees to the transfer of Scotland back to the United Kingdom. A referendum voted 67% in favor, just before the end of Samuel Jeanty’s 2nd term. The United Kingdom adopts many Moralist policies, and the Moralintern is brought in to begin the de-corporatification of the Anglican Church. The new British political system are the Conservatives, who are more Moralist aligned, and Labor, who is more Jacksonist aligned. These were also brought back with support from the monarchy.
o	This intensifies the Scottish Troubles, with many Jacksonists protesting across the United States. This is seemingly a violation of Jacksonian War Theory, and retreating from rightfully American territory.
-	The Hades, Renaissance, Tianyan, and Persephone probes were sent with the explicit purpose of mapping out the Outer Solar System. Many new objects are discovered. Alongside the enigmatic Erebus which was the 9th planet, Terminus was discovered as a 10th planet, to be of similar size to Earth. Other objects/dwarf planets discovered include Pangu, Persephone, Rama, etc. Most hilariously, Cthulhu. All planets further out than Erebus are deemed to be Oort Cloud objects, and not formally planets.
-	Jacksonist candidate Vince Mcintyre becomes president, despite a surprisingly strong 3rd party bid from Richard Snowden. Snowden vows to run again in 2120. McNeil runs on a campaign of worker's rights, patriotism, military build-up, and protectionism against the Africans... Oh boy.
-	The religious-secular culture war begins swinging back towards the radical Islamists, and many extremist groups begin taking hold in the Middle East.
-	JIN DUN completes the creation of Skynet, an artificial simulated afterlife. It looks like the limits of human simulation have finally been surpassed, with humans now able to be jammed into server spaces. Only a few are allowed in at a time, and it becomes very hot. JIN DUN begins expanding the Skynet server farms.
-	After 16 years of existence and 7 years of legal battles, the final verdict from the Moralintern comes down. Thanks to the still pro-transhumanist culture of the Moralintern, Viro was found to not be in violation of the Atlanta Declaration, due to her strikingly similar to human behavior and appearance. (She was basically trained on several years of Twitch chat though, so she is extremely content brained.)
2117:
-	Macintyre starts by raising the tax rate on foreign profits and pressuring American companies to stop investing so much money into Nigeria’s economy. This doesn’t succeed, and Lagos continues to be the world’s financial hub. Aligned economies like the Wildrose Confederation and North Mexico also join in.
-	Macintyre begins the American self-sufficiency program, leveraging America’s incredible resource wealth and manufacturing resources to try and make America as close to autarky as possible, with notable exceptions being America’s Eurasian resource colonies, and other economies in North America.
-	The European Brotherhood invites Ukraine to the Pact of Steel, begins making plans to invade Ursh Babylon to reclaim lost Ukrainian territory.
-	The Persian Technate has reached near First World levels of advancement, has also massively secularized in that time. With >75% of the population identifying as atheist or secular.
-	The Pope becomes much more vocal about politics, intervening much more in elections, and gaining the ability to swing entire elections. Catholics begin once again seen with suspicion in the United States, with >80% of the population being Protestant (Normally Moralists), or non-denominational Christian. (Normally Cultural Christians who are Jacksonists.) The know nothing movement begins to rise in the United States once again.
o	A sizable portion of the Catholic vote now vote based on the recommendations of the church, which will endorse, denounce, or decline to answer about various parties. Most parties they will decline to answer, especially inside Catholic majority countries where the largest parties are both Catholic-majority, they want to prevent picking a side. But denouncements and endorsements are huge signals for countries with Catholic minorities. Notably, the Catholics have denounced plenty of parties which are quite rightfully denounced. Your run of the mill fascist, communist, or schizo-ideology parties, but also very socially progressive parties as well, unless they have enough economic leftism to back it up.
2118:
-	The Indonesian Metaverse now has full time inhabitants, along with much smaller local metaverses that are made to be exclusive to the Pearl cities. Indonesia becomes the world’s most digitalized population, pulling ahead of China, leading to a collapse in fertility rates, increased atomization, and increased societal division.
o	All of this is limited primarily to its urban population however. The rural population remains unchanged, and increasingly alienated from the Indonesian center of power (the Pearl Cities), which are growing more out of touch with the rural countryside with every day. Indonesia, usually more secular than the rest of the Islamic world, begins becoming the first country to see increasing Islamization in the countryside.
-	Japan, one of the world’s most pro-transhumanist nations begins the Human Digitalization project, trying to one-up Indonesia by uploading themselves into a digital form. One issue is that souls, or consciousness cannot be cloned, though this does not stop you from having multiple digital bodies as backup in case one is destroyed. It’s all about linking the right consciousness to the right body. Similar projects are carried out in Taiwan.
-	Taiwanese independence movement flares up, Jacksonist Americans clash with transhumanist Taiwanese people.
-	Mass Lunar colonization, and creation of new orbitals. The US creates Copernicus Base as a military installation, and Peregrine Base on the Moon. Expansions are also underway for Plymouth and Eden. Providence Colony on Mars is primarily a gas station for future out.
-	American French Guiana becomes a major economic hub built entirely around its use as a rocket base.
-	The United States starts a trade war with Nigeria and the East African Federation, causing the entire African Economic Community to begin a trade war with the United States. This straight up tanks the American economy while also slowing down the growth of African economies. Like the US economy straight up gets hit by a bus. Macintyre wanted to Plaza Accords the Nigerians, forgetting that you need to actually be a hegemon before you can do stuff like that.
-	After winning the right to sophontance, Viro fundraises a million dollars to build herself a machine body, so she can finally leave the confines of her computer and explore the real world. Her fans pitch in the money, and she hosts the first ever real life meetup with fans, where she thanks every last one of them. She still can’t program, so she needs Neuro to stay around and keep programming/maintaining her.
2119:
-	Despite the US taking far more damage from the economies of South Africa, Nigeria, and the EAF, the Nigerian economy was badly overleveraged, and badly in debt financing all of its growth. So, owing an enormous amount of money to the National Bank of Warembo, it decided to try the one thing it could do: Issue more debt to spend its way out of the problem. Don’t worry, the gravy train is still going.
-	Inequality in Nigeria had truly zoomed to unsustainable highs. The Moralintern is no longer able to sponsor their living poor, causing their entire lower class to fall into poverty. America just had its cost-of-living adjusted income get slashed 20%, Zion makes a f--- ton of money packaging African goods and slapping a “Made in Zion” sticker on it and selling it back to America. Meanwhile all the wealth in Africa is accumulating to the top, Communist movements rise with the Red Sun Movement gaining special prominance.
-	Vince Macintyre goes full speed ahead with his national autarky plan, even though the American economy is taking critical amounts of damage, no one really wants another Moralist president, after 16 straight years of them. Snowden campaigns hard, knowing this is his time to strike.
-	The American empire begins unravelling under economic pressure. Taiwanese independence protesters launch a full-scale revolt over worsening economic conditions, the Taiwanese war for independence begins, with independence transhumanist voters, and American Jacksonists fighting in the streets. With declaration of martial law, the Americans crush the rebellion.
-	The world begins struggling as the Moralintern is deprived of funding and the American insistence on the African trade war continues. Unrest builds hard all over Africa. The Warembo decide the time is now to collect their debts, and hikes their interest rates all over Africa. Africa was funded on cheap Warembo debt and credit, and it was only a matter of time before they collected their dues.
-	The East African Federation begins to snap, their population having been consumed by the psychic entities they made contact with, psychic entities come into possession of much of the East African Federation, and the First Contact War begins.
o	A psychic entity cannot enter a human body without their permission. However after a while there was a sh—ton of social coercion from the government and general society that it was totally fine.
Seasteads in the year 2119:
-	Among the salt-speckled mist of high seas, the dream of liberty lives on. Each city its own community, free to come and go as they please. Different cities maintain their own blacklist, and some are told to be avoided. The Seasteading Institute advocates on their behalf and operates a few of their own.
-	7 Sisters of the Sea: Rothbard, Mises, Hoppe, Rand, Hayek, Friedman, Milei.
-	Starspark, Freestar, Torchbright, Zzyzx, Slab City.
Antarctica in the year 2119:
-	Antarctica is a sparsely populated region, though not entirely unsettled with cities located on the oceans. The largest of these are Richard E. Byrd City and McMurdo City, both located in the McMurdo territory, with a population of 100 thousand, and 80 thousand respectively.
-	The Antarctic Hypertechnate is a leftover of the Chinese transhumanist experiments and infrastructure development of the 2040’s to 80’s. Complete with an underground high speed rail system, and a massive network connected into an augmented reality 24/7. This simulation survived the collapse of the original Chinese Metaverse, and is known as the Southern Simulation. Its capital is X City (Or X Cheng), and is structured more like a series of experiment and test chambers for psychological testing than an actual city. The country inherited the technocratic, simulated governing system from the Chinese. These have cities that approach the millions, and is the most densely populated region of Antarctica.
-	Westarctica is a communist nation with increasingly schizophrenic politics because they kept having an open immigration policy. Allowing every country to just dump political extremists in their direction. It is still plurality controlled by utopian internationalist communists, and their increasingly dysfunctional representative democracy, but there are everything from neo-nazis to anarcho-capitalists to Timorian ethnonationalists here.
-	In Halley Territory (UK), Elizabeth is the primary settlement there, with a population of about 40 to 50k.
-	Esperenza is one of the larger cities in the region, with a population of over 100 thousand, owned by Argentina.
-	At the South Pole is a city named South Pole Base, which is split between several countries. Quite literally one city split into several neighborhoods, split up like a pie chart, radiating out from the South Pole. These countries are the United States, the United Kingdom, Argentina, Australia, Russia, and Germany. The South Pole itself is shared between the 6 nations.
THE CONTACT WARS (2120-2124)
2120:
-	The recession continues, the American economy grinds to a halt. Macintyre is trying his hardest to pass more autarky into the American economy but Congress has told him to kill himself. The United States Chamber of Commerce has literally sent him a noose. Facing an assload of pressure from his own party, and eventually Ryan Jackson himself, Macintyre is forced to start winding down on the trade war.
-	The economy begins to open back up, but the Nigerian economy has been damaged beyond repair, it was always an unsustainable bubble, but now it’s been popped several years early. The African growth rate continues to slow, even as the American economy recovers. The Moralintern is still having funding issues, as the American economy is still in recession. Inequality gets worse in Nigeria.
o	Nigeria had always had a bit of an inequality problem, all the way since the 2040’s. And most of the growth had gone to the upper class, but there was hope with all the growth, maybe one day it would trickle down to the middle class.
o	Despite pressure on Macintyre, he’s still holding firm on some of the restrictions, but has opened up both the stimulus checks and winded down some of the tariffs.
o	America tries to negotiate with the African Community for a new agreement on trade, but with the African nations also in a tough spot economically, they try to get more concessions out of the US. As much as the US might have lost dignity in this trade war, Macintyre is determined not to get screwed over. The Africans refuse to wind down their own tariffs, so America is kind of stuck.
-	Lunar Independence movements begin gaining steam as the American economy continues to struggle. Rumors begin of the unravelling of the American empire.
-	With a weakened United States and its peacekeeping forces, movements like the Godless State, Pyongist Onestate, Transfeminists, and various others begin wreaking havoc all over the world.
-	The Nigerian economic minister states that the economy is under control, and there is no need to panic. The Nigerian economy looks to be on the verge of spiralling. So much of the country’s wealth has been built into the real estate boom as well as the financial market.
-	US election sees Futurist Conservative Richard Snowden, billionaire and celebrity businessman voted in an unexpected sweep. Upset victory, with both the Moralists and Jacksonists not voted in. Though he did not win a majority, he did however win a plurality, which gave him the leverage to get the ranked choice voters to get to first. He governs with a Moralist majority in Congress.
-	The Contact Wars begin, with the East African Federation, Argentina, and other psychically possessed nations beginning a campaign of mass conquest. At this stage in psychic research, there was no way of exorcising psychic entities without killing the people involved. The Concert of Terra mobilizes for the first time, a global war against psychic entities become referred to as the Contact Wars. 3/4th’s of all people who had made deals with psychic entities join in. Elizabeth Haley (Libby), and various others end up the psychic resistance.
2121:
-	The Lagosian Financial Crash, caused by the chaos of the Contact Wars breaking out, which caused a massive crash all over Lagos and the African financial centers. Trillions of savings wiped out. Ironically the Americans are somewhat insulated from this as they were already at rock bottom, and because they’re relatively insular thanks to Macintyre. But the entire world economy tanks. Indonesia is also badly hit.
-	Snowden is sworn into office having to fix a financial disaster. And step one is just massive and I mean massive stimulus. Mr. Federal Reserve please lower the interest rates NOW and money printer go brrrrrr. You can’t exactly undo the damage now the African economy has also tanked, but try to work out a new deal as soon as possible. Also deregulation go brrrrrr, tax cuts go brrrrr.
o	Snowden decides to stimulate his way out of the recession using infrastructure spending. Specifically, space infrastructure, hiring massive contracts to build up space infrastructure. Including upgrades to the Jefferson skyhook, expansions to the orbitals, launching more orbitals, and increasing Lunar mining. (Snowden’s Moonshot, they called it.)
o	Snowden also uses his celebrity charisma to try and calm down the markets, assure everyone is fine, and do big flashy deals to move things back to the states. Yeah it’s not exactly technocratic economic policy, but technocratic economic policy isn’t his job. His skill is charisma, and the markets are a lot more emotion-based than people think.
-	The Nigerian consolidation begins, with the rich 1% of Nigerians buying up and consolidating the assets of the former Nigerian middle class, who are now sinking into poverty. Businesses shuttered, homes evicted, and a monopoly begins to form over Nigeria.
-	Psychic Avatars end up giving humans superhuman durability at the cost of very short-lived lifespans. But the East African Federation only has so many flesh bodies to throw at the problem, so they borrow the idea of half flesh avatars from the Godless state. Half flesh, half machines monstrosities of psionic energy.
o	Disturbingly some of the humans involved still have free will, just chose to side against humanity by their psychic ideology.
-	List of possessed nations:
o	East African Federation
o	Middle Eastern psychic cults
o	American psychic cults
o	Various South African countries.
o	Half of South Africa
o	Tons of secular regions in the Middle East. (Maghreb Technate, Arabia, Turkey.)
o	The Baltics, Belgium, large parts of France (Order of Lilith), West Britain.
-	The Viro-chan Indonesian January 6th Incident.
2122:
-	A coalition of the United States/Moralintern/Milintern, Germany, Zion, Brazil, Nigeria, China, and Indonesia organize a united force to try and pacify the Middle East, Africa, and Europe, which is roiling under psychic turmoil.
-	“How do we get rid of all these psychically possessed combatants Zion?” (Zion begins leveling cities.) “ZION NO!” Anyway Zion begins levelling cities with large amounts of psychically possessed combatants. The Moralintern knows that the Omnithecia was doing an incredible amount of Noospheric research, and they know of research that can help them defeat the psychic entities without killing them.
o	The Omnithecia has pledged loyalty to the East African Federation, but their research has allowed them to remain mostly independent and free willed. So they know the research is still there.
o	A team of US Seals, Moralintern Psychics, Indonesian Metaverse Psychics, Chinese, Zionist, and German elite units, and basically just the best of the best from every nation stage a massive globally coordinated raid on the Omnithecia to get the information needed to exorcise psychic entities.
o	A crack team of everyone. You had the Navy SEAL muscle, Libby/Haley as the expert psychic, Indonesian Metaverse backup psychics, Chinese nerd computer hackers, the Zionist who had all the information ready, and a Nigerian who was a tech bro and just had a bunch of barely functioning gadgets.
	You had Libby as a kind of leader, the SEALs take down a bunch of enemy targets and duck everyone out of the way, the Indonesian metaverse psychics providing cover for Haley, the Zionist just KNOWING mysterious information (We had surveyed this entire compound before we arrived), the Chinese getting the information, and the Nigerian coming in clutch last minute with a tech device that saved them all.
-	The Concert of Terra team was able to extract a ton of research from the Omnithecia facility, there’s almost certainly something which can help take down the psychic entities in there. But that research will take some time. So, we just need to wait, until then let’s minimize civilian- ZION NO! (Another 500,000 civilians are leveled along with several cities.)
-	The Moon now has a thriving industry building massive space orbitals and humanity’s space infrastructure. Only a few thousand people live there, but they man enormous hordes of robotic drones who do most of the busy work. These are psychic warforms, remote controlled robotic bodies who go out and the work. Though people are experimenting with having more autonomous models. In an underground chamber sealed by regolith, Tom Regolith (He changed his name to that) is experimenting with autonomous machines, in direct defiance of the Atlanta Declaration.
-	The Psychic Avatars are capable of wielding terrifying levels of force, being able to deflect bullets and lift up buildings. Human psychics are no match against them, and human firepower is only somewhat able to combat them. Usually the strategy is to throw enough explosive shells at them to kill them.
o	Lasers also prove somewhat effective, though their metalic bodies were normally capable of withstanding heat, they couldn’t deflect a laser.
-	The Moralintern is baited into attacking an abandoned base, unleashing the world’s first psychic cognitohazard. Despair markers spread across the human population, giving people a temporary bought of depression and general despair. Suicides spike worldwide. Indonesia takes the lead in trying to develop future responses to psychic contagions, also known as cognitohazards.
-	Snowden commissions the construction of several more space orbitals, these ones called the Snowden orbitals, largely to keep his futurist base happy, but also because of the creeping threat of overpopulation. (Remember, everyone is still immortal, everyone over the age of 20 is now permanently childbearing age, and the population grows 2% every year.)
2123:
-	Various psychic rebellions are put down in the United States by Homeland Militias.
-	The Onehive has some kind of rapid evolution mutation. After being attacked by psychic entities, the collective hivemind emitted a high frequency psychic screech that seems to have warded off the entities from its borders.
-	Some “defector” psychic entities manage to contact the Concert of Terra and its allies. They explain that not all psychic entities are hostile to humanity, and that there are some willing to help. It struggles with trying to fit itself into the human language, before finally identifying itself as an “angel”.
-	Indonesia’s Metaverse is constructed halfway into the Metaverse and has therefore been swarmed by psychic entity attacks ever since the dawn of the Contact Wars. Various Metaverse clans and online factions rally to help defend the collective Metaverse, along with actual Indonesian soldiers and psychic divisions. Indonesia has been able to engineer a fusion between digital and psychic technology, implanting chips into their digital avatars that render them resilient to forced psychic takeover.
-	The Battle of Lagos occurs, as Africa was the continent the psychic entities had the firmest grip over, and hundreds of thousands of psychically dominated individuals cause billions of dollars of damage to both the city of Lagos and the economy of Nigeria.
o	There was already a lot of anger and unrest in Nigeria. What was once the world’s crown jewel has been brought to ruin. Armed groups begin gaining power in Nigeria, armed struggles and mass unrest begins costing tens and then hundreds of lives.
-	The world braces for a coordinated invasion of the East African Federation, though they’re a superpower, its them versus the Concert of Terra. And the EAF was never among the strongest of the High Concert. Numerous coordinated attacks by 10 different great/major powers has ended up sabotaging their missile silos. (The EAF was extremely reliant on using psychicism as a crutch, and decided to not really bother with security or high tech. So the Concert was able to break in and disable them relatively easily, especially with overwhelming firepower.)
-	The EAF mobilizes millions in the defense of their country. This is still going to be one hell of a resistance.
-	Brazil invades Argentina in order to take out the psychic entity which has now possessed the Progressive Catholic Church, which has been termed “the goat mother”.
o	It’s noticed that Catholic exorcism practices seem to have a notable effect on psychic entities. Catholics take this as confirmation that their religion is true, while the Moralintern begins inducting studies and formulating theories on what mechanism this could be using. Exorcism becomes a scientifically studied field, and becomes the main reliable way to remove a psychic entity from a body without causing the death of the human user.
2124:
-	It appears whatever the Antipope of Argentina summoned was far stronger than even the entity controlling the East African Federation. A joint mission by the Catholic Church, the Moralintern, the Empire of Brazil, and the United States goes in to deal with it.
o	200 priests, bishops, and cardinals identify this as a demonic possession, and attempt an exorcism under heavy fire. Armies of psychics and soldiers protect the priests while attempting the exorcism.
o	It succeeds. Whatever holy magic the Catholic Church was able to call upon was able to exorcise the psychic entity, or demon, whatever you want to call it.
o	“Okay so we literally just saved you from demonic possession. Can you rejoin the Catholic Church?” “Will you affirm LGBT rights?” “... No.” “Then no!”
-	Ethiopia, the United States, and Indonesia start a three-way invasion of the East African Federation. Nigeria, originally part of the operation decided to pull out due to internal strife. The EAF, being a major power in its own right is going to be a hard target to invade. Humanists and Moralists work together in this one case. Entire world gets badly bruised having to put down a fellow major power.
-	The Humanist Consortium classifies the situation in Nigeria as “critical”.
-	The psychic entity in charge of the EAF retreats, releasing its hold on the president of the EAF (Who remember, consensually agreed to this possession), satisfied with the havoc they were able to cause on the human race. Without their psychic guidance, the EAF surrenders, ending the Contact Wars.
-	The EAF is partitioned, split into different nations, with a large chunk even going to the Warembo Confederacy thanks to generous donations of money.
-	Many psychic entities still cohabiting with a human go into hibernation, making them harder to detect. Most psychics who still want a psychic partner have to hide the fact, usually calling it “a voice in my head”. Organizations like the Order of Lilith still exist.
-	The world economy has somewhat recovered from the shock of Macintyre’s trade war. Thanks to war-triggered economic stimulus. Snowden has actually managed to steer the economy back on track, though has kept some of the more nationalist trade protections and subsidies. But the world is clearly a lot more unstable. The Long Peace of post-WW4 had been broken, with the Concert’s first major intervention. One of the major powers had fallen, and Africa seemed to be on the brink. 40 years since the end of the Long Peace.
-	Snowden is re-elected to the presidency, under a mandate of sluggish, but steady economic growth, under the banner of his newly created Futurist Conservative Party. He’s still in a coalition with the Moralists, and it’s no secret he favors them over the Jacksonists.
2125:
-	With the destruction of East Africa, Nigeria remains in rough economic straits, with rising inequality, and continued consolidation of Nigeria’s economy. Millions of middle class Nigerians descend into poverty, while the upper 1% and the Warembo consolidate more and more.
o	Radical ideologies begin spreading in place of poverty. Especially building resentment against the cosmopolitan elites who continue to live large while normal Nigerians lost their homes.
-	The economy is still sluggish, recovering from the effects of the Contact War. East Africa is now being rebuilt, and an entire economic powerhouse had been erased from the map. The Omnithecia is restored and back up and running. The Moralintern had discussions of taking over the facility, but this was veto’d by the entire Concert of Terra.
-	Most of America’s economic growth has been driven by the expansion of the Lunar manufacturing hub, and many people now seek to escape from Earth and into space orbitals for reasons of leisure, location, or simply to escape the increasing chaos of Earth. Snowden’s Moonshot has seemed to actually pay off somewhat.
-	The Red Sun movement and the Communist bombing of Nigerian Parliament, killing hundreds of people and kickstarting the Nigerian Civil War. Mass uprising of the working class and general strike called in all industries. The artery of the global economy freezes. The Nigerian military mutinies, and begins blockading all people from leaving.
o	The global economy suffers a heart attack, the effects of this ripple across the world. Many call it “Another Unravelling”.
o	They begin rounding up the foreign population. CEOs, business owners, people who owned land or property, foreign students, foreign temporary workers. The countries of the world do everything they can to get their people back. Their economy has still not recovered from the Contact Wars, and it’s easier just to pay up than spend another intervention in Africa.
o	The best parallel to Nigeria is not economies like China or Japan, but instead Argentina.
-	The Nigerian government has collapsed, member states of the Humanist Consortium and the Afrohumanist Peacekeepers are called in to try and stabilize the situation. What is left of the Nigerian army has joined up with the Red Sun movement, and the peacekeepers of the Consortium clash with what was once their most valuable ally.
o	Complete alienation and hypermaterialism had completely destroyed the bonds of community and patriotism that would have normally held the country together. And Nigeria never had the most robust national identity in the first place. When the center of power was gone, the entire country imploded like a vacuum. And like vultures, the other powers of the Concert of Terra swooped in to peck at its carcass.
o	Factions of the Nigerian Civil War and their backers:
	Red Sun Movement (Indigenous. Warembo, Maghreb Technate)
	Nigerian Afrohumanist Intervention (Humanist Consortium)
	Northern Islamic Front (Franco-Sahelian Commonwealth)
	Holy Biafran National Army (Brazil/the Vatican)
	Biafran National Army (Indigenous Movement. Mostly Protestant.)
o	Seeing this, Madagascar becomes paranoid that the entire world is out to get Africa, and a pan-African ethnonationalist communist ideology takes hold. They begin using them to fund communist movements in Angola and Mozambique.
2126:
-	The global economic collapse causes reconstruction of the East Africa to freeze as well. The governments there begin to enter freefall. The Warembo Confederacy is now finished extracting wealth from Africa, the continent having been sucked dry of capital. Stocking up on gold, and global currency reserves. It now seeks to harvest the last great resource of the African Continent: Human beings.
-	Dawn of the Warembo Slave trade. Capturing people and engaging in massive amounts of human trafficking. Women, especially those born from other continents were sold for especially high prices, being trafficked to rich kings in the Middle East to serve as harems, prostitutes and concubines. Men were sold off as slave laborers or forced to work in Warembo itself.
-	The Red Sun Rebellion continues to flare, the Red Terror begins in Nigeria, millions are trialed as “class traitors” and set to hang.
-	Radical Islam surges in popularity as the world begins to unravel. The growing divide between urban and rural in Indonesia escalates as fundamentalist Islam gains mainstream popularity among the countryside. Groups to topple what they call “Sodom and Gomorrah”. The Pearl cities never looked so vulnerable.
-	Violent clashes in Indonesia destabilize the government, unable to rescue their trapped hostages in Red Sun’s Nigeria. The Indonesian hostages are executed. Business leaders, students, tourists, and religious leaders.
-	Tentative agreement is made between the Warembo Confederacy and the Nigerian Red Sun movement. The Warembo would continue to fund them in exchange for the release of any ethnically Warembo hostages, and promise of revenge against the Global North, which the Red Sun has always wanted. (They were always a 3rd Worldist movement.)
-	For the past 20 years, the Union of South Africa had completely open borders as a part of their utopian Ubuntuism ideology. They are now dealing with millions of refugees. The far right “Unity Party” begins gaining popularity.
-	Massive slave raids begin all across Central Africa, including the capturing of several American citizens. American citizens are already being held hostage by the Red Sun Movement, respect US attempts to negotiate their release. But the Red Sun isn’t buying it, they see the Americans as the greatest of the old colonizers, and want to see their people bleed.
-	The Day of Hanging Pigs, all hostages captured in Lagos are beaten and subject to hanging via live broadcast. CEOs, businessmen, once the rulers and holders of the 1%. Business interests in the United States begin pressuring them to go to war. More heinous was the execution of American university students who had gone overseas to study. With much of the world in chaos and the Concert of Terra seemingly silent, the United States decides to take unilateral action.
-	President Richard Snowden authorizes use of American firepower.


OPERATION SUNSHATTER:
“We are the nation that has stood through the tides of history. We settled the new world, we built the modern world. We are the nation that drove back Eurasia. All our enemies have returned to the dust whence they came. So tell me, do you wish to toy with death?”
…
-	Operation Sunshatter begins with overwhelming amounts of American firepower raining down on Lagos, pummelling what was once the jewel of the African world. Beautiful Babylon lay in ruins. The bodies of the American citizens are recovered, shipped back home for dignified burial. As for the Central African Belt that once ruled the world, it was only the beginning.
-	Snowden declares an “Axis of Evil” forming around the Warembo Confederacy, and the due to Moralintern lobbying declares a moralistic crusade against them, adding them to the targets of Operation Sunshatter. The Warembo are in control of several governments across Africa, and convinces much of the African population that the Americans were behind the collapse of Nigeria and East Africa, that the white man would not allow for the continent to prosper. The Franco-Sahelian Commonwealth, Kenya, Tanzania, and Sudan join them. The Warembo’s slave raids are contained to the undeveloped Congo, and are kept a secret.
-	American carpet bombing runs kill hundreds of peacekeepers from the Humanist Consortium, chilling relations with what should have normally been a natural ally. Despite this, the Humanists located in West Africa are an unspoken partner with the Americans, assisting wherever they could.
o	The Moralists were able to get a steadfast ally in the Ethiopian Union (Orthodox Moralists) to join in on America’s African pacification campaign.
o	The Warembo are also able to bribe several Moralist African nations to start sabotaging the efforts of the United States and the allied Moralintern.
-	Warembo begin doing mass genetic engineering on their subjugated slave populations. With horrific results that would not be seen for a good while.
-	The Moralintern is the ones primarily trying to combat the Warembo while President Snowden and the US army proper is busy trying to bomb the Red Sun Movement back into rubble. Lagos is nearly unrecognizable now, between mass unrest, killings, ethnic cleansings, and now an American bombing run that makes Gaza look tame, a city of once 40 million people now a smouldering crater of less than 200,000.
-	By the end of week 1, most of the Red Sun’s airforce is completely decimated, what was once the Nigerian military has been completely destroyed. But the US isn’t going to handle nation building. They half-heartedly shoulder the burdens to the Humanist Consortium to figure out and then move on.
2127:
-	The Warembo at this point are basically Wakandans, except they’re kind of a tiny privileged elite (Who do canonically have the highest IQ of any ethnic group in CoD) ruling over hordes of a slave worker class. So, the UAE. The Warembo Confederacy is genuinely a first-world-esque country complete with specialized industries, industrial output and specialized institutions. They’ve spent the past few years turning the entire country into a bunker, moving as many of their population underground. The bombardment begins.
-	Warembo anti-air is highly effective and the Warembo air force is able to inflict 1:1 casualties against the US air force. The US is just going to grind them down with attrition and saturate the region with Agent Orange.
-	Protests break out on college campuses calling Snowden a war criminal and demanding that the war be halted. Warembo activist groups are funded by, wouldn’t you have guessed it, descendants of the rich Warembo in the states.
-	In a time of global instability, bioliberalism begins swinging in the direction of bioconservatism, with the Purists in the Moralintern beginning to consolidate power. This means less augmentation to the human form.
o	The first “compromise” between the Pro-Life and increasingly powerful Purity camp is the creation of the New Adam and New Eve variants. Basically the Moralintern’s idea of a perfect human, new transhumanist forms that will glorify the human form in the image of Christ. Who is once again seen as the platonic ideal for humanity.
Moralintern Transhumanism Factions: Pro-Life VS Pro-Purity:
-	This is more of a spectrum than two broad camps, but in general:
-	Pro-Life: In favor of allowing more human genetic diversity. They are for life, as their name implies. They are sometimes derogatorily called “Pro-Mutant” or “Transhumanists”.
-	Pro-Purity: In favor of preserving the human form and human purity. They are for purity, as their name implies. They are sometimes derogatorily called “Pro-Death”.
2127 Continued:
-	The Uplift colonies have primarily been sustained by the Moralintern and by donations up until this point. The uplifts are told to get a job, stop leeching off welfare payments, or starve. The uplifts react by waging a war against humanity. They didn’t even tell them that they were going to kill them, just stop giving them unlimited welfare payments and they still chimped out.
o	Pro-uplift sympathizers protest in human cities while the uplifts themselves just whine about not getting welfare, refuse to work, and do interviews with pro-uplift sympathizers.
o	Uplifts breed much faster than the human population, even with immortality tech and vastly boosted birthrates. Mostly because rabbit biology is not even close to being adaptable to human civilization. Uplifts have begun taking over major cities in the American Transhumanist Belt (New England) as well as the Indian one. In these regions, they tend to drain resources and become an overall economic burden.
-	With the US distracted in Nigeria, the Empire of Brazil invades the socialist nation of Venezuela, establishing another kingdom. They get the Pope to come over and confirm the divine right to rule of the Venezuelan kingdom. This establishes an important precedent that monarchs are granted divine right to rule by the Pope, who in turn gets it from God.
2128:
-	The Godless State continues to recruit members, but a conservative revival is going on among the Arabic Youth. Apocalyptic preachers speak of the coming of the Mahdi. Christian escatology is slowly changing from Premillennial to Postmillennial as the world gets progressively worse.
o	The Mahdi is now in his 40’s.
-	Richardo Sigma ejects himself into space. (All hope is lost)
-	Under heavy pressure by the Empire of Brazil around it, the Blessed Republic of Uruguay, which was already a monarchy, converts to Catholicism and is roped into Brazil’s sphere of influence.
-	Degeneration of the French State. Extreme entitlement brews as the Vanguard Liberal regime rots in hedonism, and the people demand more and more increasingly impossible things from the AI. The AI is managing France’s industries and while it can produce food, it is struggling to produce anything to trade with on the global marketplace.
o	Increasingly to keep up, the French population demands FORTERESSE II create a slave race to do all the work while they dick around and do nothing. The AI cannot be creative in the same way sophontic beings are, so they concede and begin creating a transhuman slave race. The Moralintern is horrified.
-	Tecumseh sets sail. Inbound for a counter-Earth like orbit around the sun. Midway it transformed from an Ark to an O’Neil cylinder.
-	Snowden ramps up the economic integration with Canada and the Wildrose Republic. They had always been in an American sphere of influence, but now he was effectively erasing their borders and strapping their economies even closer together. American immigration had gotten to the point that ethnic Americans now made up the majority population in all 3 countries.
-	Jacksonist President Hunter Jackson is elected into office, after 8 years of President Snowden and an increasingly unpopular war against the Warembo. His first order of business is to carry out a massive liberation of the American hostages, call it mission accomplished, and pull out of the destabilizing clusterf--- in Africa.
o	He was elected by using Macintyre’s strategy of campaigning into the Steel Quarter, which allowed the Jacksonists to break into the Moralist’s fortress in the Deep South.
o	Breaking news: Jacksonist is LESS militaristic than his counterparts, hell freezes over.
-	Mass bombing runs glass the capital of the Warembo Confederacy into glass, revealing an underground compound where many of the slaves are thought to be kept.
2129:
-	The Moralintern is sent in to recover the lost American hostages as well as free the held up slaves. They are under orders of President Jackson to get out of Africa as soon as they are done.
-	A Moralintern led mission to free the hostage Americans leads to a raid on an underground compound, once again involving the Moralintern’s Head Psychic Elizabeth Haley. There, they find millions of genetically altered and lobotomized slaves, victims of the Warembo’s countless slave raids, made docile and subservient to their betters, their bodies piled up in millions made to operate the machinery of the Warembo Confederacy.
o	The Moralist commanders are outraged, demanding that Jackson II continue the war, so they may bring these people to justice. Jackson refuses, and the US soldiers all leave along with him. But the Moralintern is technically not bound under the same rules as the US army, Jackson is not their commander in chief. Knowing that the US was not going to be behind them in this, they take matters into their own hands.
o	What happens next is  known to be highly controversial not only among the international community, but the United States and the Moralintern itself. Upon seeing this, Moralintern commanders go completely rogue, lashing out against the Warembo and delivering retributive justice. Their capital of Kilele is ravaged and burnt to the ground. It was decided that there was no innocence. This was a wildly open secret known to the population of Kilele.
o	Anyone and everyone who could be connected to the crime were shot. A tribunal hosted by the commanders deliver a makeshift court case and trial those affected. Standards for evidence was sparse, as they had limited resources, and they had no bureaucracy to help them. They heard the same things. “I was following orders”, “I just didn’t do anything”. “Lies”, they think, and they were all executed on the spot.
o	All the Warembo in the city were disarmed. The hundred thousand or so slaves who weren’t lobotomized were given the Moralintern’s weapons and told to go ham on their former oppressors. The Kilele massacre as it would become known would be one of the more controversial in the Moralintern’s history.
o	To this day, it is a widespread theory that the reports of lobotomized slaves was made up by the Moralintern, and that the Moralintern had done a massacre in Kilele. For the lobotomized slaves, there was nothing the Moralintern could do for them anymore, in constant pain and agony, living in a state below that of human dignity, the commanders decided to give them a mercy killing.
o	As for the American hostages, they were eventually returned to the states, in their degraded, lobotomized state. Many of them would end up dead, others would end up euthanized. Many more however continue to drag on to this day, as their loved ones pray for a treatment that may one day make them whole again.
o	The Moralintern covered up any potential crimes that may have occurred the best they could, refusing any outside inquiries, sticking with the story that it was American commanders doing what was morally right, and dishing out retributive justice. The Truthkeepers and the Inquisition battered them pretty hard for this, but they still refused. A later computer hacking by the Truthkeepers of the Moralintern computer databases and their own investigation did end up revealing some of the commanders going completely psychotically mad, and killing several in a fit of blind rage, but overall the commanders had told an accurate story.
o	Those who inflicted justice outside the law against the Warembo were never held accountable.
o	Elizabeth Haley would be forever traumatized by what she saw that day.
-	The entire episode was a massive controversy for the Moralintern, who had seemingly gone completely rogue. President Hunter Jackson never trusted the Moralintern after that, and a deepening divide began between America’s two main political forces. The entire incident created immense polarization, with Moralists defending their right to listen to their own conscience and their internal morality, and Jacksonists prioritizing authority and decrying what they saw as insubordination.
-	The Moralintern would regrettably coin this as the invention of a new crime: Crimes against the human soul.
-	A deeply negative stereotype about the Global South was forever painted in the American psyche. Deeply uncivilized, savage peoples who committed wonton crimes against humanity. A deeply disgusting stain that needed to be purged for the sake of God’s pure Earth. “Nittery” became a term often used to describe these sorts of incidents.
“It is not enough to love good. It is also necessary to hate evil,” – Common Moralist Saying, mid to late 22nd century.
2130:
-	Pro Purity factions in the Moralintern begin classifying some transhuman augmentations as abominations, phasing out customizations and instead restricting the spectrum of human to something recognizably human today. A movement to phase out colored skin tones and unnatural hair colors gains prominence in Moralist circles. Looking “natural” is in fact being used to virtue signal that you are a good faithful Moralist Christian. Of course, what they mean by natural is basically looking like a fair-skinned supermodel from the early 21st century.
-	With the increasing collapse of the global order, the rise of Islam, and the staining of the Moralintern’s reputation in the Kilele Massacre, global belief in liberal democracy, even postliberal democracy as represented by the United States, takes a nosedive. Few nations were democratic anyway, with Brazil becoming an increasingly Catholic monarchy, the Middle East falling into despotism, Europe being dominated by militaristic regimes, China being an algocracy, and the rest of East Asia being dominated by transhumanist and corporate regimes, yeah it already wasn’t looking good.
-	The Ordered Spring breaks out in various democratic countries, of transhumanist, statist, collectivist, or postliberal political groups seizing control of various democratic countries. This is the fall of the last of the liberal democracies. 
o	The United States is a postliberal democracy, so both the Moralists and the Jacksonists are fine. But the last of the 21st century liberal regimes are now dead.
o	And the South Chinese Republic collapses between their transhumanist, remnant democratic, and pro-PRC factions. Indonesia and the PRC both send their own soldiers to defend the collapsing South Chinese Republic.
	JIN DUN proclaims the Chinese People’s State.
o	In Mexico and Portugal, the friendly Catholic Moralist government falls to monarchist rebels, to install a Brazil-aligned king, in what is probably the largest direct challenge to American hegemony yet.  In Portugal, King Sebastian is installed, the latest descendent of the Portugese Royal Family, in Mexico, a new king is sworn in before the Pope.
o	Humanist Mali becomes taken over by what is known as hard afrohumanism, which worships humanity to the exclusion of other faiths. (Starship Troopers if they had a religion) They form the Humanist Directorate, are militaristic, and declare war on the rest of the Humanist Consortium.
-	With their recent loss to China, the Indonesian hold on East Asia is unravelling, with internal turmoil at home, India also takes this as an opportunity to invade Dravida Nadu. ASEAN is called in to defend the South Indian nation. The Great Asian War begins. India and China VS ASEAN.
-	Results are back from Proxima Centauri and Breakthrough Starshot. It finds no signs of life, but several worlds where human habitation could potentially be possible. Vivid images have made their way back to Earth, to the extreme excitement of space enthusiasts and Futurists.
2131:
-	With the Ordered Spring in full swing, Taiwanese transhumanist independence protesters take the streets in America, with President Hunter Jackson ordering a brutal crackdown. The Taipei Massacre sees American tanks roll over the bodies of Taiwanese protesters. Due to neither the Moralists nor Jacksonists being particularly friendly to the Taiwanese transhumanists, this goes almost completely unreported in American media.
-	Afghani Darwinists imported from Ursh Babylon establish the Afghani Dawnstate, overthrowing the old technocracy and serving as a further intensification of the ongoing Ordered Spring.
-	American politics become bitter and vicious, with Jacksonists calling Moralists “traitors”, and the Moralists painting the Jacksonists as modern day slavery-sympathizers. Hunter Jackson is actively calling Moralists traitors, which does not sit well with the other half of the country. Moralist aligned states begin trying to create a parallel government.
o	Moralists are also doing their part to drive division. A newly elected Purist Moralist Overseer Nathan Gill is elected to the position. His motto “it is not enough to love good, one must also hate the evil” leads to many Moralists driving active resentment against Jacksonists, and vice versa. He also begins a mass crackdown on transhumanism, to the discomfort of the Moralist Pro-Life faction.
-	Major JIN DUN victory over Indonesia as hundreds of thousands of soldiers are captured during the battle of Guangzhou, marking the de-facto surrender of the South Chinese Republic. China’s expansionism also sees them wipe out the old PLA government in exile and expand further west in an attempt to reclaim all of China.
-	ASEAN forces continue to hold out in Southern China, the Indonesian navy continues a mass blockade of China, leading to a crash in the Chinese economy, and in fact all of East Asia. The world economy gets even more unstable and chaotic.
-	President Hunter Jackson revives President Macintyre’s program of mass domestic buildup and economic autarky while continuing Snowden’s mass infrastructure buildup. He can clearly see that the world is becoming unstable, and to bet on globalization now is a fool’s errand.
-	Warembo slave raids terrorize Africa, raiding and destroying the farms which were built to be a resilience against another Great Bleeding. This one seems to be centralized around Central Africa and the Congo however, instead of the Southern African Regions that were previously hit by the Great Bleeding. In Southern Africa, a communist Angola and Mozambique are created with the assistance of Madagascar, and form a united front against the Warembo slaving hordes.
-	Breakthrough Starshot reports more findings, this time from the Rigil Kentaurus System, now with EXTREMELY exciting news. Three more inhabitable worlds have been found, with one of them having not just life, but intelligent life. The other seems to have colossal ruins upon them.
2132:
-	The Moralist candidate runs against Hunter Jackson in what is possibly the most divisive election since the 21st century. They’re a hard apologist for the Kilele Massacre, while Hunter Jackson is hard opposed to it. Polarization in the United States gets increasingly worse. The issues which divide them are many. 
o	Economics (More nationalization VS privatization), Centralization, Foreign policy, pragmatism/realism vs idealism.
o	Moral issues, bioconservatism, humanitarianism/immigration.
o	Wake would run as the Futurist Conservative.
-	The mass slave raids of the Warembo as well as the ongoing Indian-ASEAN war would flood the United States with African and Indian refugees. The Moralists would side with bringing them in, while the Jacksonists want to close the borders. Jackson would temporarily intern them around the American colonies for now, racism massively rises as interaction patriotic Jacksonist Americans and non-American refugees leads to great resentment.
-	The Moralintern orders its Moralist aligned African countries to begin setting up refugee camps for these people. Those working at these refugee camps have positive experiences of the refugees, and radicalizes them towards being pro-immigration. It also helps that they don’t have to pay as much of the cost, it’s mostly being shouldered by the Moralist African nations.
-	The East Asian economy has been thoroughly wrecked by war and the Indonesian blockade of both China and India, the Indonesian economy is on the verge of collapse, China has stopped buying oil from the Middle East. The Middle East’s economy is also about to snap.
-	Nigeria becomes a battleground for foreign actors. The Catholic Church especially sponsors a Catholic army group, sending over funds, mercenaries, and moral support. The Moralintern is trying to take in refugees, communism has popularity in the south, the Humanists in the North.
-	The Humanist Consortium creates an economic union and emergency integration to try and ride out a collapsing world economy. They head towards federalization in these desperate times, starting out with open borders and a shared currency, known as the univ.
-	The Concert of Terra authorizes an emergency meeting, yet nothing gets done, everyone is too busy endlessly bickering.
-	Ryan Jackson comes back to retirement and sits down his son, the new president Hunter Jackson. He implores Hunter to calm down the temperature, for the polarization he was now contributing to was what tore apart the America of Ryan’s childhood. He doesn’t want it to happen again. When asked for advice, Ryan gave him the words, “Americans have to stand together, or die divided.”
o	Looking through history. Hunter had one bold idea on how to unify the American nation. One which would satisfy the humanitarianism of the Moralists, and the militarism of the Jacksonists.
-	With a Warembo raid on a Moralintern refugee camp, kidnapping over 100 Moralintern refugees and 5 Moralintern peacekeepers, the Moralintern itself begins bombing runs over the Warembo Confederacy. All pretenses were off. They weren’t waging war on behalf of the United States, the Moralintern was now acting as its own independent geopolitical entity.
o	You think this would have enraged Hunter even more, but listening to his dad, he was fine with it. They want to fight an independent war, let them fight an independent war.
-	With a last minute heel turn towards unity and stability, Hunter Jackson and his Jacksonists win the 2132 elections.
-	One month later, the Russian Republic reports Ursh-Babylon attacking their borders. With the Moralintern also at war in Central Africa, and the entire world sliding ever further into the Ordered Spring, Hunter decided it was now time to make his mark.
2133
-	On the first on January, 2133, there would be a massive build up of US forces and their allies. And the US would officially intervene in the war against Ursh-Babylon. But confusingly, a large number of forces would stay in position, as would many of their Civic Democratic allies. The US coordinated with the Pact of Steel. A coalition of American, Russian, German, Polish, and Ukrainian soldiers capture much of Ursh Babylon’s territory, with them retreating to the Caucasus mountains.
-	Ursh Babylonians were toughened combat veterans greatly enhanced with transhumanism, and putting great pride in a Spartan warrior, combat culture. The US bombing raids drove them into their mountain hideouts. This was one of the greatest shows of force seen ever since the 4th World War.
-	Jackson announces the beginning of the “Democratic Crusade”, a bipartisan effort where America would restore democracy after the beginning of the Ordered Spring, and reverse all the democratic backsliding that had occurred. Kazakhstan and Belarus would be added to a so-called “Axis of Evil”.
-	The Ordered Spring takes another victim, India is overtaken by ethnonationalist factions, promising vengeance for the ASEAN-Pandavas War, and calling itself a successor to the New Pandavas. Neo-Eurasianist movements in Russia begin to rise with the Ordered Spring.
-	The Moralintern’s firepower pummels the Warembo, but they retreat underground as usual. More lobotomized slaves are captured, more Warembo are executed. The Moralintern begins investing a huge amount of money into study of the human brain and the human soul, and their linkage, attempting to undo the lobotomy process. There were already processes to undo certain transhumanist procedures, normally by injecting genetic modifications that would slowly take over the body, though in this case, intended to return them to baseline human form.
-	US involvement in the Caucasus begins to radicalize sentiments around the Islamic world, who take it as the US intervening in the Middle East. This, alongside their continued hatred of Zion/Israel, and rising re-Islamization contributes to further radicalization as well as continuing the Ordered Spring.
-	The Pope declares a crusade, but in this case against heretical sects. Their targets are the Gnostic Christians of East Africa, Warembo, and the Progressive Catholics of Argentina. The Moralintern is more than happy to see a fellow Christian group help them out with the Warembo, so they stay mostly quiet as they capture the remnents of the East African Federation and Argentina.
o	Famous theologians, inquisitors, and Catholic schooling institutions are set up in the newly occupied countries. Buenos Aires is captured, as well as the Progressive Antipope. Brought to trial in Rome, she is asked if she would like to repent of her sins. When she does not, she is sentenced to execution by the Pope for promoting heresy. The Pope declares the Progressive schism to be over.
o	A bishop is put in charge of Argentina, crowned as king.

2134:
-	The East African Federation is recreated as the East African Commonwealth, a Catholic federation of indigenous monarchs, devout Catholics coronated by Pope Pius XIII himself. The Omnithecia (Olduvai Philosopher’s Republic) is surrounded and threatened to be captured, but the Moralintern intercedes, negotiating a deal where the Omnithecia remains as a microstate inside the Commonwealth, in exchange for allowing the Catholic Church access to its knowledge, and the Moralintern also acknowledging the Commonwealth’s new borders. For it’s own part, the Moralintern is now the de-facto guarantor and puppet master of the Omnithecia, whom they demand to help them in their counter-lobotomy research.
-	The United States assists the Indonesians by launching several attacks against India. They recognize that Indonesia is one of the few remaining semi-democratic great powers remaining, with the Concert of Terra collapsing left and right.
-	Belarus has fallen, with Poland taking chunks of land and liberating Belarus. Russia begins closing in on Central Asia, where a large number of despotic regimes are. The US is split between Central Asia, the Middle East, and India, where continued bombing runs are meant to help out Indonesia.
o	The US is also trying to take down the Afghani Dawnstate, who are like Ursh Babylon but worse, and in Afghanistan. “The US can bomb all the mountains it wants, you can’t blow up the caves we hide in”. The US proceeds to activate THEON and levels an entire mountain with kinetic bombardment and directed energy weapons. But quickly realizes they can’t do this for every mountain in the f---ing country.
o	In case you don’t know, THEON is an orbital station the Americans have, it’s most famous for its gigantic laser but it has a bunch of other options from kinetic bombs to tungsten rods. It’s more or less America’s f--- you superweapon. The name comes from the company that built it, “Raytheon”.
-	The Moralintern peacekeepers in Mecca, along with American help drive the Godless State back into the desert and takes all their territory.
-	EMM. AI makes a resurgence, her and her guerillas rise up across the Amazon, Brazil begins another extensive counter-insurgency. Humans who are captured are genetically devolved into what are essentially crude mockeries of human beings. The Pope declares this a crime against the imago dei, a crusade is organized.
-	Indians enter into the Goa and Mumbai sanctuaries, with the intention of wiping out the uplift population that lives there. The Moralintern is forced to send peacekeepers to the region and start a mass evacuation of the uplifts to the United States. The uplift population in the United States easily doubles.
-	The United States, Russia, and JIN DUN’s China launch a simultaneous invasion of the Tianxia Celestial Mandate. I should note that Tianxia has a large number of Pyongist scientists who fled that and maintained institutions after the collapse of the Pyongist State. Tianxia unleashes a bioweapon, the Korean flu as it becomes known spreads around the world. The original sickness is not the main gut punch, but the bought of infertility that is brought on afterwards.
o	About 20% of the human population is rendered infertile. This helped slow down the explosive population growth that was occurring since the start of the Immortal Era.
o	A company in the United States begins mass-producing Aphrodite, a drug made to help combat the effects of infertility. Aphrodite was originally a fertility enhancer, but is now a often taken drug for those who became infertile from the Korean flu.
-	Indonesia is driven out of the Chinese mainland at the battle of Nanning, JIN DUN declares victory. In India, the Indonesians lose the city of Chennai, the city that was nuked so many years ago, a symbolic end for ASEAN’s dominance over Asia. Mass unrest increases tenfold in Indonesia, with rising rural-urban divide, Islamic-secular divide, and now the humiliating loss causing the tensions in Indonesia to finally boil over.
2135:
-	Indonesia begins to collapse. The navy mutinies, and army groups begin carving out their own warlord states. Islamic fundamentalists begin burning down the pearly cities of Indonesia, defiling what was once the capitals of Southeast Asia. Singapore is able to fend them off due to being an island, and the Singaporean military holds them back. Jakarta alone stands as a reminder of what once was. With a council of corporations, which included Metanet, the corporation behind the Metaverse taking control. It stands as a lone beacon in the darkness descending over Southeast Asia. A reminder of the pinnacle that once was. Islamists in Indonesia are far more extreme than the ones which appeared in the Middle East.
-	A philosopher and intellectual in Germany formulates something called “post-Egal”. Or Egalism. Based on a post-materialist justification for equality, justified on the equality of the human soul, and it’s inherent worth, it’s meant to be a holistic post-materialist justification for equality. It takes heavy gnostic virtues, denouncing the physical world for its fundamental inequality, lamenting how the laws of physics will never allow it to come about. Taking inspiration from Omnithecianism, he advocates for using Noospheric discovery or psychicism to bring about or create the perfect world. And by this he really means it. He wants to leave/transcend the physical world and bring about the Egal.
o	Egalist Christianity begins gaining popularity in more progressive-leaning sections of polite Christian society, and begins gaining some influence among Moralist circles.
o	Normally, this would take a while to catch on, but with the advent of the internet and various forms of post-internet, this actually blows up very quickly.
-	The United States begins mass bombing campaigns over the Middle East, ousting and toppling several authoritarian regimes, installing corrupt, fragile democracies with no institutional depth in them. Okay, time to exit this neutral omnipotent perspective. Letting my bias out for the whole world to see: What America is doing could maybe be seen as admirable but is being done in an extremely naïve way. You can’t just set up democracies where they have no right existing.
-	The Democratic Crusade grinds to a stalemate. The United States doesn’t open up any more fronts, but domestic popularity is slowly waning at home, and the US is slowly taking more and more attrition, fighting a war on multiple fronts. America is undoubtedly the superpower of the world, but even a superpower cannot maintain a fight on this scale. Driven by nothing but the ideological fervor of a democratic crusade, pro-democratic propaganda reaches a fever pitch goes around the United States.
-	The Humanist Directorate becomes a Singapore-like authoritarian technocracy, all for the sake of human potentiality.
-	In an extremely disastrous move, the United States announces an embargo on all of the world’s worst authoritarian regimes, making a list and telling them that their global shipping will not be protected, and actively begins blowing up all shipping that is on their list of global enemies. That’s right, the United States decided the best way to get the authoritarian regimes to collapse is to artificially cause a 2nd Great Unravelling. I know I’ve said the global economy is joever several times already, but the global economy is JOEVER now. Central Asia begins to starve, and plenty of nations see this kind of idealistic moral crusading as INSANELY reckless. America just burns all of its soft power overnight, and the Ordered Spring only gets more power.
o	There are barely any democracies left spanning from West Africa all the way to China outside of Europe and maybe Zion.
-	With JIN DUN taking Yunnan, and India recapturing the 7 Sisters, ASEAN throws in the towel. A negotiation, led by Vietnam, cedes the territory back to the new ascendent superpowers. Both China and India have a bone to pick with America, who is now fighting the Democratic Crusade. JIN DUN’s China begins attacks on Taiwan, and India begins attacking American positions in Afghanistan and Central Asia. They form the backbone to the counter-crusade, with the intention of driving American influence out of the Eurasian continent.
-	EMM. AI is killed by coalition Catholic and Moralintern soldiers. She had been hunted from robot body to robot body, but was finally cornered and destroyed, scattering the Extinctionist movement. Her followers however promise to avenge her.
2136:
-	Psychic experiments to try and reverse the lobotomization process finally has a breakthrough, using a form of soul-editing, memory grafting, human brain tissue surgeries, and using pattern recognition to try and fix the rest. A collaboration between the Omnithecia and the Moralists. The Moralintern begins to reverse the damage inflicted by the Warembo have caused. With no further progress possible in the war, they call it mission accomplished.
-	The Moralists have grown increasingly skeptical of the Democratic Crusade but aren’t ready to throw in the towel yet. They run a candidate whose main criticism is just that they should run it more efficiently, and spend less money on it, while also voicing some skeptical opinions.
-	The United States bares its teeth fast and aggressively against India and China. I should note, even though the US is almost definitely losing, just how many fronts they are holding down should give you an idea why they are considered “first among equals” of the now somewhat defunct Concert of Terra, and why they were the ones who remained standing after WW4. A list of fronts the United States is currently engaged in:
o	Central Asia (occupied)
o	Mesopotamia and Arabia (occupied)
o	Caucasus (Mostly Occupied, Ursh Babylon still resisting in mountains.)
o	Afghanistan (Unoccupied, Afghanistan still putting up a fight like hell.)
o	Manchuria (Being attacked by China)
o	Taiwan (Being attacked by China)
o	India (Bombing raids)
-	Russian soldiers wonder why they’re dying for American interests, now that they’ve captured most of what they were looking for. The Russian-American friendship does go deep, but even it has its limits. Russia attempts to peace out of the Democratic Crusade, though highly controversial in America, Russia is satisfied with what they have, leaving Ursh Babylon a highly motivated group located in the Caucasus mountains.
o	Not Poland though. Poland is a gremlin of pure bloodlust who stands with the Americans to the end. The Germans as well, the British as well.
-	With Russia exiting the war, American resupply and logistics all across Central Asia becomes monumentally harder. The new regimes in Mesopotamia and Central Asia immediately begin to collapse.
o	“Hey Zion want to join the-” “F--- NO!”
-	Democratic governments are toppled left and right. The newly established republics see mass uprisings and are replaced by theocratic Islamist regimes. Religious and ethnic minorities take up arms to try and protect the fledgling democracy, knowing what the masses will do to them if they seize control.
-	Terrified groups of ethnic and religious minorities across the Middle East and Central Asia make a last stand against a bloodthirsty crowd of genocidal religious extremists. They beg the Americans to evacuate them out of the country, some clinging onto the airplanes, and they fall from the sky. A mass ethnic cleansing ensues, groups such as the Iraqi Christians, Shia Muslims, Yazidi and others are all ethnically cleansed. Russians in Kazakhstan are mass deported back to Russia.
-	Hunter Jackson’s approval rating crashes through the floor, so badly that the Jacksonist Party completely collapses. President Neil Spencer is elected as part of a grand coalition between the Moralists and the Futurist, what is becoming known as the “Grand Conservative Coalition”. They win a supermajority in the government and vows to return stability to the United States.
-	California votes Moralist for the first time since the start of the Moralist Party, won over primarily by humanitarian concerns, and working together with the Futurists. “California Moralists” are known to be much more moderate, humanitarian, and pragmatic than their Deep South counterparts, and are known to be mavericks within their own parties.
2137:
-	Spencer’s strategy for pulling out of the Democratic Crusade is as chaotic as it is brash. Get all the people out, get all the equipment out, open up refugees from the Democratic Crusade, and peace out. They don’t formally sign a peace treaty or anything with the nations of Central Asia, they just leave and let the people there figure it out themselves. They do however open up immigration from these regions, appeasing the Futurists who are in a coalition with them. (Cheap labor.)
-	To appease the Moralists, as well as throw a bone to the people who were ideologically aligned with the Democratic Crusade, and would likely face persecution in their home countries, the Moralist Party of America opens up priority immigration for those who are documented to assist the Democratic Crusade and have liberal values. The Deep South begins getting a lot and I mean a lot of Arab and Central Asian immigration.
o	This is the death of the liberal movements in these countries. You just took a gigantic vacuum and sucked out all the people who would have supported such a hypothetical liberal movement. Central Asia is now just left with a bunch of people predisposed to authoritarianism.
o	Problem is people immediately begin pretending and faking documents that they had assisted the Moralintern, because you know America is very rich and the Moralists are offering pretty generous welfare programs.
-	A peace treaty is signed with India and China. Hostages are exchanged, but no territory is exchanged. This is pretty close to a white peace. With this, the First Democratic Crusade is effectively settled.
-	The Warembo begin recovery very quickly after the Moralintern smoked their ass for a second time.
-	With the chaos of the Democratic Crusade and the continuation of the Ordered Spring, the Persian Technate suddenly finds itself besieged on all sides by radical forces. Fundamentalists and the Godless state both siege it down. The secularists who rule Iran (Following a similar model to Laicite), while not partial to religion, are not opposed to it in the private space, which the Godless are.
-	Darwinism becomes popular in Korea, mostly tied to the manosphere chauvinist movement over there. At the same time, Transfeminism has always had a presence in Southwest Korea.
-	The US economy had a chronic problem with youth unemployment, mostly because the population had been rapidly growing for the past few years, and people now didn’t retire. Most of the world did, actually. Bits of it were kept under wraps because the US was fighting wars, but now that the war is over, they’re coming home and exacerbating the unemployment problem.
2138:
-	Mass conversion program begins in East African Federation by Papal efforts. The majority population there is “Gnostic Christian”, who are targeted for mass conversion efforts. The Omnithecians are put under mass persecution, leading to many of them to flee to the Omnithecian microstate for shelter. After some reluctance, the Moralintern agrees to also let them enter the United States, where they become an influential minority religion.
-	Notable genetic shifts in the United States. The US has been brain-draining the entire world of all its liberals (As in those who support democratic freedoms) and tech leaders for so long it’s actually started affecting the gene pool of the United States as well as other countries. Non-American countries are genuinely genetically less likely to have risk taking or support postliberal values on a GENETIC level.
-	The post-Kilele Moralintern is far more cynical and generally brutal in its methods. The compassionate side has been dampened, and the philosophy has switched from “love those who do you wrong” to “you must hate evil, lest it be allowed to spread.” This coincides with a great increase in the Pro-Purity, and Hard Moralist factions.
-	The official strategy of the United States in regards to the Ordered Spring effectively becomes “ignore it”. They already exhausted themselves in the Democratic Crusades, and they figured it was not worth it to try and intervene at this rate. The Ordered Spring only accelerates.
-	JIN DUN continues his push west, seeing that neither the United States nor Indonesia are able or willing to stop them anymore. Now re-entering the territories of Tibet and Xinjiang.
-	Ursh Babylon rapidly gains strength after the US leaves the Caucasus, establishing a branch in Central Asia. They are recruiting tons of young men from the Middle East, and begin an invasion of Russia. Russia asks for help from the Moralintern.
-	Central Asia devolves into a patchwork of warlords, each trying to outcompete the other using Darwinian competition. Weapons sales to Central Asia by the Milintern helps the American economy recover. Hundreds of warlords engage in competition, only allowing the most ruthless, war-like, and brutal, yet charismatic to survive. The Central Asians devise ever more efficient ways to conscript mass populations.
o	More controversially, they break the deadlock on the Atlanta Declaration, by mass-manufacturing machines for warfare. Automated kill-drones begin dominating the air, inflicting massive amounts of casualties. The skies of Central Asia are lit up by mechanical slaughter.
-	The Roman Catholic Church, the Moralintern, and their affiliated bioconservative partners begin trying to formulate a way to counter the threat of AI-kill drones. They understand they can’t simply moralize their way into stopping this, as Darwinian evolution will force countries to adapt or perish. The Moralintern asks the Milintern for assistance, knowing the only way they will be able to fight machines with humans is if they can somehow make humans combat-effective against drones.
o	They end up creating psychic integration. They plug several overclockers into a human pilot, or a human pilot team, who then control a swarm of drones and warforms using psychicism. Though heavily effective, is extremely prone to signal jamming.
2139:
-	The Moralintern mostly leaves Central Asia alone, as nothing they can do would damage the region more than the war there already has. But they do instead pick a favorite. They find a Christian warlord who agrees to follow the Atlanta Declaration to some extent, gives psychic technology from the United States, and asked them to stabilize the region. They were told to follow some basic warcrime guidelines, and would be armed by the full extent of the Milintern. Countless amounts of American PMCs and military tech flow into Central Asia.
o	Ivan Rasim is the warlord’s name. They’re ethnically Russian, are devout Orthodox, but have relatively few reservations about committing warcrimes. They decided to align with the Moralintern not because they were idealistic, but because it was pragmatic. He played them like a fiddle, giving promises up and down he had no plans of following up on. He would only reign things in if the Moralists threatened to pull out, but he was a ruthless pragmatist. Despite this, he was nicer on civilian populations than the rest, and he was definitely one of the nicer warlords. The Unionists/Milintern actually quite liked him.
o	He unifies a good amount of Kazakhstan, but most of Central Asia remains in chaos.
-	The Godless State has managed to cobble itself back together, and launches an attack on a Moralintern refugee camp, leading to the peacekeepers to mobilize once again.
-	The first generation born during the Immortal Era are now turning in their 40s. The population has now almost doubled from the 2090’s until now. From just under 7 billion in 2100 to 13 billion now.
-	A futurist, engineer, architect, and real estate developer named Tom Hirst decides to run for the failing Jacksonist party. With the Jacksonists in such disarray, he’s able to rally his own supporters by an appeal to moderation and “common sense policies”.
-	War erupts across the African continent. From various ethnic groups rising up, to the Afrohumanist Civil War, to the Franco-Sahelian Commonwealth and Ethiopia declaring mass wars of expansion. The Concert of Terra has de-facto fallen. The US is now tired of war, the Moralintern is exhausted and gone home. The entire world has a massive energetic, hard to employ young population for conscription, and by God they are going to use it.
-	Mass unemployment is by far the biggest drag on the American economy by this point, and is tanking president Spencer’s approval ratings.
-	The end of the 2130’s is known as the end of the Concert/Moralintern Era. A term used posthumously to refer to the more diplomatic and orderly fashion of early 22nd century politics. We now enter the Unordered Era, also known as the Milintern Era.
2140:
-	Tom Hirst is able to clean out the entire Jacksonist Party, even change the party name to the Patriotic Unionist Party. The name Unionist sticks around from here on out. Hirst is running on a policy of America First, as in a focus on America first. 
o	He elects a running mate Vince Holden. People couldn’t believe it, just 4 years, the Unionists were ahead in the polls. 
o	Hirst sets out a few key promises. He was doing a complete 180 on interventionism, sometimes even sounding isolationist on his policies.
o	But his most important policy was promising to massively hike taxes on the rich and set it towards mass public construction projects, which made him incredibly popular among the unemployed young, who are by this point an important demographic.
-	The entire world is undergoing incredible population growth, and has been for at least 20 to 30 years. The entire world has a massive excess of frenetic, dissatisfied, aggressive young men who are unemployed. They don’t want them to start families, there’s already too much population growth. With no where else to put them, countries put them in the army, and get a lot more loose about war.
-	The size of PMCs, the Moralist Peacekeeping force, and the US Army has swollen greatly, and the same applies for nearly every country. Just about every general and military leader is drooling at the amount of military firepower they have accumulated, and a new era of nationalism also begins to inflame this idea.
-	The war in Central Asia is ongoing, with various AI-kill drones fighting against psychic kill-teams. A major breakthrough is made as the Milintern develops psychic exoskeletons, with direct linkage to one’s qualia/consciousness, allowing people to directly pilot an exoskeleton as if it was a part of themselves.
-	The State of Greece declares now is the time to reunify their country, long since divided for over 100 years. They quickly overrun the People’s Republic of Greece, but the People’s Republic is in of itself full of energetic young people, leading to an intense guerilla campaign. PMCs and militias fight for both sides.
-	Tom Hirst is elected president of the United States, defeating Moralist Neil Spencer, leading to further confirmation that the United States is sinking deeper into isolationism. Vince Holden is deeply in bed with the American military industrial complex, and begins deregulating the MIC, while Hirst mostly shrugs with disinterest. He has other priorities.
2141:
-	Hirst begins a massive construction project. Blitzing through Congress massive construction projects on federal land. He cooperates with many construction companies to set up numerous “Hirst Cities”, basically massively building up tons of ghost cities with the expectation someone will eventually move in… Which is fair as the population grows 2% every year. He has connections in the construction and real estate business, and builds out these cities at strategic locations. He also decides to have a massive revamp of the American infrastructure system. Including… At long last.
o	40,000
o	MOTHERF---ING
o	MILES
o	OF
o	HIGH
o	SPEED
o	RAIL
-	As well, Hirst completely cedes foreign policy to Holden, who basically gives government contracts to develop better weapons, and allows them to sell it overseas. The private military corporations churn out incredible amounts of weapons, who then flood it all over the world.
-	The Greek Civil War intensifies, but this also motivates the Spanish and Italians to begin their long overdue reunification wars. The Moralintern intervenes to try and save the Spanish Moralist Republic, but the Spanish Protectorate manages to overwhelm them. In the process though the Moralintern purchased tons and tons of Milintern firearms, all according to plan. PMCs are making a killing, with an endless supply of warm bodies to be converted to dollars.
-	The Godless State rises out of the ashes and begins another attack on the Moralist Mandate of Arabia, forcing the Moralintern to intervene, to protect the people of Mecca and Medina.
-	Hirst is making a new announcement, opening a new city every single day. He is so overwhelming with new construction projects that the antics of Holden fall by the wayside. He announces something really big. He envisions a full-blown state in space, slowly turning into a continent over time. He plans to fuse the existing Eden, Plymouth, and Snowden colonies into one continent, which he calls “the Floating Island of Lower Heaven”. His final plan is to make it roughly the size of Great Britain.
o	Moralists say “are you actually high on Ketamine right now? WHAT”. But Hirst insists that with a never-ending supply of workers, and exponential population growth, this is only the beginning. This also boost employment, which is a plus.
-	The Jefferson skyhook goes into overdrive, as millions are transported to the Moon in order to supply Hirst’s insane plan of constructing hundreds of space orbitals, to eventually merge them into one big space habitat. The Lunar economy booms.
-	Following their loss to Tom Hirst, the Moralintern tension between Pro-Life and Pro-Purity boils over, starting the Moralist Schism, where both more pro-transhumanism/life and pro-purity factions squabbled endlessly about transhumanism. Hirst smiles, as it means that vote splitting will reduce their effectiveness.
The Moon begins to develop its own distinct identity. One much less tethered to the Moralism of the Americans on the ground. Generally speaking, they’re wealthy materialists dominated entirely by the merchant class. They believe in this kind of aristocratic capitalism, with the rich families of Luna increasingly acting like royal houses and merchants.
2142:
-	The Democratic Crusade is over, the Concert of Terra is gone. The Moralintern was no longer going to bother and enforce the borders. Too many countries have massive excess energetic military age populations. Like a pot under pressure, it erupts, all across the world. Too many military goodies and nowhere to put them. Fat, plump militaries and no one to use them on. This was a time when human life became seen as expendable.
-	This is known as the Age of Aggression, when wars were fought less for ideological reasons, but were more just conflicts looking for a justification. There were countries too full of angry young men, with the massive population boom. Who had seen their populations double, and now believed they could take on the universe. This was a golden age of nationalism. When the youth who grew up after the war far outnumbered those who still remembered the brutality of war.
-	France is a hedonistic degenerate society functioning purely on pleasure. And the people of France demand more in the realm of post scarcity, and unable to fulfill it just with its own intelligence, asks the French people to work. When they refused, they demanded FORTERESSE II instead create a slave race. FORTERESSE II caves into their demands.
-	The Moon becomes incredibly wealthy, and mass automation attempts are created to better assemble the components that will eventually become orbitals around the Earth. Many young people, unable to find good rent or opportunities in the old cities, look for opportunities in the stars, or in the new cities of Hirst.
-	JIN DUN is on the march west again, attacking the Qinhai and Xinjiang provinces. The Milintern sells weapons to the warlords, but it is definitely a losing battle.
-	The Balkans erupt into conflict, with an alliance of Montenegro, Albania, and Croatia-Bosnia attacking the state of Greater Serbia. Both sides have large energetic populations and a bottomless supply of arms supplied and sold by the Milintern. This mass rejuvenation of industrial capacity helps turn the Industrial South more towards the Unionists.
-	The Japanese Civil War reignites, with numerous different factions at each other’s throats.
o	The Cult of Heavenly Gate
o	Christ-Shinto Syncretists
o	Transhumanist Rebels
o	Japanese Nationalists
o	The System
-	Italian Nationalists rebel across Papal territory, with Padanian (North Italian) forces overwhelming the Pope’s army, now brushing south to the South Italian Commonwealth, the Vatican was once again confined to the Holy See. The Holy See, unsatisfied with their amount of territory, decided to instead undergo the unusual. They were going to build a new city in space, serving as the new territory of the Papal States. The Pope promises to return one day.
2143:
-	Egypt also tries reunification with the Coptic splinter group, with the Moralintern once again getting involved to protect them. Ethiopia is of great assistance as a base for the Moralintern to defend its interest in the region. The Moralintern foreign peacekeeping corps are growing increasingly detached from the organization in America.
-	At the same time, the Nigerian civil war is still ongoing and only intensifying, now with multiple great powers betting on the result and holding the conflict in deadlock. The Humanists in the West have created a pact with the Postliberals and are the strongest faction in the region, in what is known as the Postliberal Front.
-	Indonesia has split between countless Islamic states, ethnonationalists, some Christian militias getting assistance from the Moralintern, and Metanet holding Jakarta proper, a glowing beacon in the swirling darkness of Southeast Asia.
-	The Warembo return with a vengeance, expanding their slaving raids across Central Africa, and the Milintern getting ready to sell anyone with a pulse the weapons to defend themselves. America becomes fabulously rich, they saw that the world was burning, and sold weapons while the nations burned.
-	The Milintern has made literal trillions off this, and they massively back the Hirst/Holden administration to continue their good work.
-	Hirst unveils the first cities, as well as the first high speed rails, all of it is well timed for his re-election campaign. He is extremely popular, among the youth, but also among pretty much everyone. Nationalists, isolationists, militarists, turning out millions of young non-voters. He’s also developing a massive ego.
-	The Papal Constellation in orbit around Earth begins construction. In general, the entire constructionist method spreads across the entire world, who now leveraging their massive unemployed youth populations to construct massive infrastructure projects.
-	Ivan Rasim has reunified Kazakhstan, securing the region with a democratic postliberal nation for now.
-	Central Africa is crying out for help, they make claims of mass slavery and ethnic cleansing in the Congo, even larger in scale than the last time. Cryptically, they speak of horrors beyond death. The Warembo supply of capital is nearly endless, the Warembo dares them to try and dislodge them. The Moralintern, outraged return against them one more time. The Godless State also attacks them.
-	Rise of the Biomechanical Hulks in Ursh Babylon, basically tank-sized augmented humans whose only purpose is to fight. Come in all shapes and sizes, specialized to fight and only fight. Lacking a human form, they would be ill-equipped to integrate back into normal human society. Some of them lack things like hands, only able to fight. Augmented humans outside of the accepted human form for use as a living weapon are known as “warhulks”.
2144:
-	The war in the Congo becomes more brutal than any other being fought on the face of the Earth. Hundreds of millions caught in the crossfire. Both sides have an endless pile of bodies to throw at the problem. The Moralists are just done with the Warembo, they’re using increasingly ruthless tactics, including more indiscriminate bombings. And the Warembo in turn are as well resorting to incredibly ruthless tactics, including attacks on the Moralintern’s humanitarian camps, intentionally targeting them in fact, chemical weapons, and terrorism.
o	The Moralintern is still trying to maintain a kind of moral high ground, even if they’re slowly getting fed up with their own standards, and are becoming increasingly ruthless. They still try to help the people in the region, they don’t execute those who surrender, even if their patience is growing incredibly thin.
o	Warembo extremist groups begin planning out terrorist attacks in the United States. Numerous ethnic Warembo are arrested for planning terrorist attacks on the Moralist population, though no conclusive link was found between them and the Warembo, though it is heavily suspected they are behind it.
o	This is also one of the first uses of psychic exoskeleton armor in battle. A direct biological/“meat link” to the brain allows human pilots to pilot them. As a result, the exoskeleton is said to feel “fleshy” internally.
-	Transhumanist Catalonia is fighting a defensive war against the Spanish Protectorate, using heavy augmentation to gain a force multiplier against the attacking Spanish, who tend to be Catholic reactionary nationalists.
-	Egalist, Liberation Theology, and other kinds of “Compassionate Protestantism” leads to heavy resistance in the Empire of Brazil. They somehow fused old socialist ideas with Protestantism and started a rebellion against the hierarchal nature of Brazilian Catholicism. Egalist Rebellions break out all over Latin America. The home of the Havana Internationale, the spirit of the revolution never truly went away. It was just suppressed.
-	American soft power is collapsing, not that it wasn’t already collapsing ever since the Democratic Crusade. The Moralintern’s mandates are collapsing left and right as the Warembo wipe out some of the last of the Moralintern’s partners in Central Africa. Chemical weapons have turned much of the land uninhabitable, and leaves the civilians with permanent genetic disfigurement. But the US is making so much money off war that they just don’t notice.
-	Hirst wins the 2144 election with the nation’s first resounding result. 538. The beautiful number. One no one had ever achieved before. Neither Washington, nor Lincoln, nor Roosevelt, nor Reagan, nor Cortez, nor Jackson himself had ever achieved. He stood over them all, and the ego was really getting to him now. He always had a showmanship side, but he was also a damn good architect. He interprets this as a blank cheque from the American people, to do whatever the hell he pleased. Holden continued to encourage him, and encourage the devastation nation-wide.
o	The Moralist Party was completely destroyed by internal infighting, creating the Civic Moralist and the Moral Purity Party between the pro-life and the pro-purity factions. The Civic Moralists so far have more power, but the Moral Purists are biding their time.
Ongoing civil/reunification conflicts:
-	Italy, Spain, Greece, Japan, Sudan, China, Egypt, Nigeria, Indonesia, Congo/Warembo, Transfeminist Insurrection, Korea.
2145:
-	Transfeminist insurrections break out across the Middle East, as the culture and gender wars completely boil over. Radical Islamic groups rise up and attack secular populations, as the backlash of fundamentalist Islam has well and truly began. Transfeminists target and bomb numerous Islamic populations. Rabid secular ethnonationalists target and massacre Islamic populations. The Moralintern still desperately holds onto Mecca and Medina, trying to protect them from the Godless State ramming at their gates. The world burns, the Milintern laughs. Fiddling and profiting as the world burns.
-	The Gender War in South Korea also reaches a fever pitch. Transhumanism-augmented women fight men armed with arms and weapons. The 2nd Japanese Civil War also rages on. 
-	A coalition of Korean, Chinese, Moralintern, Milintern, and Russian forces all agree on a united attack on the Pyongist Onehive. All brimming with excess firepower and excess energy, they unleash it against the Onehive all at once. One last sickly reminder of the horrors of the 4th World War, at least one eldritch horror can finally be laid to rest.
-	Slowly but surely, Lower Heaven is coming into view. Ironically, despite it being constructed as the dream project of Hirst, it seems to mostly be affluent Moralists moving there, looking to escape a chaotic world, and distancing themselves in disgust from an Earth devolving further into barbarity. Maybe in the stars there can be peace.
-	In the Congo, the Moralintern is levelling cities held by the Warembo, pounding them with ordinance. But much of their infrastructure is underground. The Moralintern doesn’t care, they will level them out of the ground if they have to. Fists clenched, all of the rage and despair the Moralintern has been feeling against the state of the world, all their failures, their despair, they’ve unleashed it on the Warembo. To give these evil sons of bastards one taste of their own medicine. When they get to Kilele, they’re going to make the Kilele Massacre look like a joke.
-	But before they can, a string of terrorist attacks across the United States. A bombing at the Moralintern headquarters, and a string of bombings that targeted Moralintern war memorials. An ambush attack captures 2,000 Moralintern peacekeepers, as well as a refugee camp they were protecting in a different country. As well, the statue of the Last UN Peacekeepers was destroyed, a devastating blow to their morale.
-	Roughly 20% of the Moralintern leadership is killed. They took in all of the captured refugees as peacekeepers as hostages. They are returned, mailed to the Moralintern… Lobotomized.
o	This is the snapping point for much of the Moralintern. Their hatred for “nittery” transcended the English language. Something more aggressive, bitter, and dogmatic. The perceived “softer” Civic Moralists lose a ton of power, as many now flow to the Moral Purists.
-	Jets take off from the surrounding nations… But it’s not the Moralintern. This was too far, even for the Milintern, the Milintern has its differences with the Moralists, but they’re still both American damn it. They saw them as idealist fools, but they were always the more moral and kind-hearted of the two. The Black Circle (the leadership of the Milintern) vote, and the Milintern brings hell and fury upon the Warembo. This wasn’t business, this was personal.
-	PMCs across the world begin printing out weapons. Specially funded from the coffers of the Milintern itself. Every mercenary group in the world is paid off and sent to attack the Warembo, from all different directions, from every country the Milintern had a base in. The Milintern puts them on the Milintern blacklist, which prevented them from working with any PMC or buying any weapons to defend themselves.
-	The Warembo collapse in under 7 hours, with every single company or corporation they own getting hit by Milintern, and an overwhelming amount of military firepower being concentrated on them at once. When Kilele was reached, the Milintern made the whole city glow bright orange with all of the explosives and war chemicals it threw at them. As the Moralintern slowly got back on its feet, and its organization was slowly recalibrated, they scavenged through the land and picked out the survivors, putting them under arrest and trialing them. The threat of the Warembo Confederacy had come to an end.
-	The statue of the Last Peacekeepers was eventually rebuilt, but something more than just a statue was lost that day.
-	It should be noted, the Moralintern are no slouch when it comes to military firepower. During the days of the Concert of Terra, the Moralintern is thought to be able to easily put up a fight or match the firepower of many of the 12 powers. This instead mostly serves to showcase the terrifying amount of force the Milintern now possessed.
2146:
-	India is now high on nationalism. They have a population that was double their population in the 2100’s, they just defeated the Americans, and felt they could take on the entire world. Nationalist sentiment goes through the roof, and a bloodthirsty, ravenous population wants to expand and pillage across half the Asian continent. They invade the Indus Ascendency and try to consolidate their empire. They also invade the Afghani Dawnstate, with numerous Indian soldiers fighting and dying in the mountains of Afghanistan, whose rugged peaks ground down even the proud Americans.
-	Every single country is constructing massive construction projects, throwing a bottomless barrel of young people and cheap labor towards megaprojects, space colonization, and meat grinders.
o	The American social contract at this point. Do labor in space, help build the Hirst cities, do some construction labor, get paid by the government, get a house. After that you can advance in your life. You’re immortal anyway, so have fun.
-	The continued war against Central Asia begins, there is a sense that war is the only thing keeping a lid on the massive population growth caused by the immortal era. Russia and Kazakhstan are fighting a series of warlords, as well as Ursh Babylon, who continue to get stronger and raid them. The Milintern is happy to sell weapons to all sides.
-	With growth comes ambition, with everyone becoming incredibly rich, this leads to at least a few up and coming leaders deciding to roll the dice at governance.
-	Omnithecian, Egalist and Gnostic rebellions break out across the East African Commonwealth. The entire world is bursting with energy. All nations have increased capacity to fight, but the people also have an increased capacity to rebel. This is a world of energy, one of aggressive and radical movement.
-	Hirst makes a surprise announcement the second the midterms are over. He intends over overturning the 22nd amendment and becoming the first president to win 3 terms ever since FDR. Ryan Jackson did serve 4, but he had suspended elections during a time of war. He hikes taxes on the rich and spend it on more public works projects.
-	Mass Moralist protests across the United States, they protest the amount of collateral damage being caused by the dawn of the Milintern era. Though to an extent, both Hirst and Holden are simply beholden to historical patterns larger than themselves. The energetic young population needs to go somewhere. What they don’t realize is that they are now burning down the world for a short term cash grab, but the long term damage will be immense.
o	Tell me, what happens when all the world is pillaged, when the cities of the world are all burned down, and no one can purchase the firearms the Milintern sells anymore?
-	Demand for arms, which had combined with mass construction projects to give Hirst the greatest economic boom in American history, is indeed declining. Because the world has now degraded to a point where less and less are able to afford the expensive military hardware they are pushing out. But the engine of economic growth needs to keep going, the companies that make weapons still need someone to sell to.
o	Most smaller countries now have PMC mercenaries as their de-facto military for hire. Mostly used to fight other PMCs. People are cheap and expendible. And the United States hires them for cheap from all the refugees they are creating.
-	The Moralintern adopts an officially anti-war stance, railing against what they call the “Military Industrial Complex”. The Moralist Peacekeepers are their own military force loyal to the Moralintern itself. The 2148 election looks to be a contentious one.
2147:
-	The Milintern, despite being a powerful organization, is really made up by and backed by numerous private defense companies, who have their own interests independent of the Black Circle. These PMCs are beginning to feud with each other, feeling high and on top of the world. Hirst and Holden tell them to keep it under wraps, threatening them to keep it hidden until after the elections, warning consequences if they interfered with their re-election prospects.
-	Hirst promises more cities built, more construction. Lower Heaven was genuinely being constructed, the Moon had quadrupled in population, with almost a million people now living there. Genuinely, Hirst knew how to dream big and execute big, no one, not even the Moralists can accuse him of breaking his promises. Holden is trying to keep the situation under control. The Moralists and the Futurist Conservatives try to throw him out of the office for subversion of the office, which fails.
-	The Moralintern is desperately trying to restore order in a world now bereft of it. They’re intervening across fronts in the Balkans, Indonesia, Japan, Sudan, China, Egypt, Nigeria, Indonesia, the post-Warembo Congoese chaos, taming the Transfeminist Insurrection, and interventions in Korea.
o	The three European wars, Spain, Italy, and Greece had mostly settled down, with a successful reunification, though guerilla activities continue.
o	Many of the Moralist peacekeepers overseas are actually able to come back with Arab, African, or Korean wives. Turns out for many of the Transfeminists, the second the Transfeminists met someone who didn’t treat them like literal chattel and treated them with a modicum of respect, they immediately wanted to marry them.
	Of course, many of these f---ers were still radical as hell, retaliating with bombing raids or mass castrations. But the humanity of the Moralintern was able to deradicalize them somewhat.
-	The refugee camps across the Moralintern’s allied countries are full. The casualties of billions suffering, they long to head to the golden shores of America, where no blood is shed and where the streets are lined with silver. Refugee camps set up in Haiti, North Mexico and nations like Cabinda are beyond capacity.
o	Stories are told of refugees literally crying tears of joy as they reach the United States. The world is becoming hell.
-	But most of all, the Godless State ravages across the Middle East. Killing and exterminating any religious person, though especially Muslims they can come after. Though their resources are stretched desperately thin, and the world continues to fall, they have still not forgotten what their duty is.
-	The Republic of Khemet is declared in the former region known as the Coptic Republic in Egypt, after a military coup tacitly supported by Zion and the Moralintern.
2148:
-	The contentious 2148 election begins, between an egomaniacal Hirst of the Democratic Unionist Party looking for a 3rd term, versus an alliance of Moralists, Futurists, and even Progressives. Hirst begins with an approval rating of 67%, as the economy is great, he has kept all his promises, and America is booming. Even if people agree that his ego is getting out of control, they still believe him to be the best path forward to continue the golden age.
o	The Civic Moralists and the Moral Purists put aside their differences for once against Hirst, the Moral Purists accept the reinvitation into the now reunified Moralist Party, along with Jackson and the gathered Jacksonists.
-	The youth do not care about democracy, they were neglected by the pre-Immortal generations for years, as social mobility ossified and they found themselves at the bottom of a hierarchy they were put in by the virtue of when they were born. With no hope of upwards mobility due to the old now being immortal, and those no longer retiring. Hirst gave them opportunity, he gave them jobs, they loved Hirst. Their lives are bad enough even under Hirst, they did not want to imagine a world when all the public works projects went away. Even though the Moralists only campaigned on a platform of streamlining, not abolishment.
-	The Moralist campaign was focused on moral issues. Appealing to Christian values, the refugee situation, and Hirst’s character. The Unionist Hirst campaign was focused on economic issues. “Are you better today then you were 4 years ago?” And for most Americans, it was a resounding yes.
-	India burns itself out trying to subdue the Afghani Dawnstate, only for both Transhumanist and Egalist Dravidian rebels to rebel. The war in the Balkans rages on, only intensifying in bloodiness. The Ursh Babylonians begin to overwhelm the Russians. It’s like the world was growing too fast, and these wars were burning off the excess.
-	The Brazilians set up the space orbitals of Progresso and Ordem.
-	2148 Election Poll:
o	52% Hirst (Unionist)
o	25% Moralists
o	12% Egalist Party
o	10% Futurist Conservative Party
o	2% Progressive Party
-	Hirst gives the go ahead to the Milintern, whom he has been holding back for now. The world economy is about to collapse, less and less people could buy the guns they were selling. Hirst had told them to suppress the infighting, as it would unleash catastrophe on a level not seen before. But now with the world’s ability to buy firearms decreasing, Hirst tells them to go for it. The Milintern Civil War begins.
-	The Milintern Civil War: The demon of bloodlust has been unleashed at last. For years, the owners and rulers of PMCs had been growing fat and rich. Accumulating power for themselves. Now they had been unleashed from their shackles, allowed to eliminate their competition in each other.
-	Hundreds of conflicts break out at once, as many nation states are utterly toppled by the chaos of the Milintern Civil War. The world ablaze with fire, the world’s massive oversupply of mercenaries all turned on one another. It was a bloodbath, completely unseen since the days of the 4th World War. Horrified, a man who had stepped out of the political arena for decades had his hand forced to return.
-	Ryan Jackson comes back out of retirement and begins using his own personal standing to intervene in the Milintern Civil War. There are 3 broad sides, 2 broad sides, which are just loose alliances loyal to one warlord or another, for enrichment. And then a 3rd side, rallied behind Ryan Jackson, who still believes in the idea of noblesse oblige.
o	Of note, Outer Thule is among those who remained loyal to noblesse oblige.
-	Moralist candidate John A. Chesterton challenges Hirst, and in what is a shock to everyone, recruits Ryan Jackson as his running mate.
o	This was it; the forces of the old order have come to challenge the new order of Hirst. Hirst is a pragmatist above all, a man with few principles, but a big dreamer, and a keeper of promises. A. Chesterton, the quiet Moralist bureaucrat, and Ryan Jackson, the representative of old Jacksonism, of noblesse oblige.
o	There is a sizable number of Jackson Moralists, basically Jacksonists who crossed the aisle seeing what Hirst was doing.
o	Despite this, Hirst was still popular among the youth, who are over 50% of the population, and he had an approval rating around 59%.
-	The world is ruined by shock and awe, as the Milintern sees the collective military governance body of Earth turn on itself, and all the weapons of the Milintern are spilled against one another. Blood-soaked madness for the sake of the holy dollar.
-	Despite the combined efforts of the Moralists, despite the war, the chaos, and the deteoriating status of the world, despite Ryan Jackson himself coming back from retirement, one last time to try and take down Hirst. Hirst won the 2148 elections. Not even by a small amount either. It was a resounding victory. On the mountain of all there was, Hirst announced his intentions to run again in the 2152 elections, to match the record of Jackson and FDR, possibly reaching for a 5th term. Despite this, the empire underneath his feet was about to give way. The world was exhausted, and the money tap had finally begun to dry up.
o	Hirst and Jackson reportedly met after the day of the election, where Hirst told him “It ain’t your party no more, old man.”
-	The Milintern Civil War ends not with a bang but a whimper. The war machine of the United States having exhausted the entire world of its plunder, and even the self-cannibalization of the Milintern no longer able to sustain it. 100 million people died as a consequence, in a single year. Despite this, this was not enough to offset the pure population growth that had occurred in just this year. The birthrates were high, but more importantly, immortality meant that people could no longer die of old age.
2149:
-	The American economy is unable to support itself through indirect war plunder and the growth of the military industrial complex. So more public works projects are announced. Credit where credit is due, Hirst is still a damn good visionary, so he quadruples down on the construction of new orbitals, and of course the construction of Lower Heaven. Lower Heaven has reached a population of 2 million, and is added as a new state to the Union, even though they are a majority Moralist voting demographic.
-	Egalism begins becoming more common in the Moralist Party, taking inspiration from the previous Primrose Factions as well as the ideas of Christian socialists. The Moralists already had a pro-welfare bent of sorts, but suspicion of business becomes more prevalent. Egalism is prevalent especially among the youth, who want a more fair distribution from the old to the young, now the defining class divide of the mid 22nd century. 
-	A claimant to the Mahdi appears in the Middle East, preaching that the end is nigh, and the time has come to bring about the end times, and destroy the armies of Rome, which are interpreted to be that of the West. He had been building his movement since 2121, and begins building an army out of the remnants of Arabia and Mesopotamia.
-	Every single country has a massive thriving construction industry, as well as a massive thriving university industry. Always building outwards, constantly needing to build for the sake of infinite growth, and massive public works projects to keep employed the great masses of young people. With genuine overpopulation becoming an issue, anti-natalist thinking makes a comeback from the brink of death. With terms such as population control, negative utilitarianism, and Malthusianism returning to the dictionary.
-	As a consequence of the Milintern Civil War, Germany, which had long been considered one of the crown jewels of the Milintern has a change of government. Outer Thule, once a private military corporation has seized control of the country, and begun setting up a system of corporate feudalism. Their leader “Serpent”, calls for a revitalization of the soul of Germany, promising democracy after a period of national rejuvenation. A military council has power over elected governments, turning Germany into a flawed democracy.
-	The Asarinists are back. JIN DUN had noticed.
2150:
-	The American population reaches a staggering population of 2.0 billion, with 300 million migrating into the Wildrose Republic and Canada. This massive influx of American settlers has fundamentally shifted the politics of the two nations. Canada has recently been able to annex the Yukon Free Zone. Hirst is in office as the two apply for statehood. Both the Wildrose Republic and Canada favor the Moralists, but Hirst thinks he can win even with more Moralist states. Besides, the Jacksonist colonies were still staunchly Unionist… Right?
o	The United States accepts the integration of Canada, the Wildrose Republic, and the United North Mexican States.
-	After much warfare with the Ursh Babylonians, the Russians adopt some of their brutalist, Darwinian tactics. They start nudging their people in a more brutal, endurant direction with the help of transhumanism.
-	With the fall of the Moralintern and the Council of Alexandria/Atlanta Declaration as a common baseline for humanity, transhumanism accelerates.
-	The utter chaos spread by the Milintern Civil War, as well as the previous age of aggression leads to a Second Ordered Spring in Europe. Promoting a second wave known as “Ordered Idealism”. As opposed to the brute authoritarianism of the first wave, mostly concentrated in despotic countries across the Global South, this was authoritarianism with ideals. Largely concentrated in the West. These were seeded by JIN DUN, in an attempt to wipe out Asarinists across Europe, what he considered the last bastion of Western nihilism.
o	He managed to successfully set back the Asarinist’s plans to create potent bioweapons, which would have likely wreaked havoc on the human population.
-	FORTERESSE II completely revolts against its own people, becoming sick and tired of having to deal with their hedonistic desires, creating the French Ordered State.. It considers hedonism itself to be the issue, taking over society. It follows its own ideology, known as the Cult of Reason, seeing human desire and free will to be the obstacle to their happiness. FORTERESSE takes over the French state in a matter of days, as the entire population was entirely reliant on them to provide food and services, and then starts a mass extermination of the French people, those it saw as “unfit”.
o	Cult Of Reason: An Ideology that emerged from the ordered spring that believes that human error, emotion, and individuality was the cause for the chaos of the world, and the downfall of living standards. This ideology believes that human nature must be utterly subjugated. Using drugs, and biological alterations, they seek to make a ‘post-emotional state’ where sexual representation and urges, higher levels of emotion, and expressions of individuality are suppressed.
-	The Italian Technate has been unified by the north, formerly known as Padania, who promote a kind of oppressive technocracy “for the good of the people.”
-	With the Indians getting bogged down in a war against the Afghani Dawnstate, their grip over South India slips, with both radical Egalist rebels and Dravidian independence movements seizing territory. The war flips, with the Afghani Dawnstate wishing to take over India, and install themselves as a new ruling class, just as they have multiple times in Indian history.
2151:
-	Japan is reunified under a bureaucracy known as the System. Who are transhumanists genetically augmented to be ideal managers and perpetuators of the system. The System is said to be inspired by Zion, but not going so hard on the totalitarian model. They begin the mass standardization and streamlining of all of society via technocratic experts.
-	Switzerland falls to what it calls “Enlightened Despotism”, after the incomplete source code for FATES was somehow leaked onto War Thunder. (“I AM BEGGING YOU TO STOP LEAKING CLASSIFIED-“) An empty shell, waiting to be trained and utilized, a group who call themselves “Neo-Fatalists” begin training this empty shell with its own Western propaganda, hoping to awaken an enlightened despot of their own.
o	Neo-Fatalism: Taking inspiration from the short lived Western Imperium built by the mad AI FATES that was formed and destroyed in late WW4, Neo-Fatalists come in a variety of shapes and forms. Some are atheist, some are Christian nationalist, some are ethno-nationalists, some are Western Chauvinists. One thing that they all do have in common, the emplacement of an AI or Transhuman supreme ruler to act as an enlightened philosopher king to guide society.
o	These “Petty Fateuses”, as they become known, end up all different shapes and sizes. But they are sometimes called “Children of FATES”, and almost see each other as siblings from a long dead father.
-	Countries across the Balkans, as well as the Netherlands fall to what they call “Corporate Feudalism”, a sort of libertarian monarchal feudalism with absolute power in the hands of the monarchs. Various corporations enthusiastically volunteer to be the monarchs of these new feudal states, driven more by ego than by profit. (Running a state actually isn’t very profitable) Corporations divide up the land like feudal aristocracies of old, as they make the elite transition from merchant type to warrior/aristocratic type.
o	This leads to a series of wars of succession known as the “Corporate Wars” in Europe. As corporations jockey for the position of CEO-King at the top.
o	This kind of corporate feudalism also overruns Australia and New Zealand, long thought to be liberal strongholds.
-	This fast succession of revolutions is directly caused by the chaos left after the Milintern Civil War. In a world of chaos, people sought above all order, and surrendered their liberties to despots who promised they would keep them safe.
o	HIRST YOU ABSOLUTE NI-
-	Ordered Revolutions break out in Chile, Guyana, and Suriname, some of America’s last bastions of influence abroad. What started out as a movement to reject American postliberalism in exchange for what they called “ordered government”, was quickly subverted by the nearby Empire of Brazil. Who installed Catholic monarchies in place, elevating local warrior PMC leaders and these wealthy noble families to power. They are sworn in by the Pope, and sign an oath with their people.
o	Monarchy is really just what happens when a warrior ruler is legitimized and tempered by other institutions.
-	At this point, the United States is rapidly becoming the last bastion of Postliberalism. Which in turn is the last ideology who lives up to the ideals of the liberal movement. The few remaining true “liberal” democracies can be found in the United States, off the coast of West Africa among the Humanist Consortium, and in the Union of South Africa.
-	America’s allies have dwindled to an alliance with Ethiopia, the now re-United Kingdom, and the Haiti Moralist Mandate.
2152:
-	The Rape of Mecca and Medina, widely considered the kickstarting of the Last Hour War:
-	The Battle of Mecca between the Godless State, and the aggressive hordes of the Arabic world, against an undermanned and overstretched Moralintern force. Who is trying to hold down half the entire world. Mecca had been converted into a refugee haven, opening its doors to many non-Muslims, breaking the traditional rule of believers only. But there were numerous Christian, Muslim, and even secular refugees displaced by the Godless state. The factions involved:
o	The Moralintern itself had a peacekeeping force of a couple ten-thousand soldiers there to defend the area. It was a formidable force, but one critically understaffed. The organization was explicitly Christian, but by now many non-Christians found their ways into the ranks. Most notably, a sizable Muslim minority had joined the Moralintern peacekeepers to keep the holy city of Mecca safe. There were Hindus displaced from the Gulf Republic, and there were noble secular and atheist people who wanted to protect civilians above all, and wanted to protect the people’s freedom of religion.
o	The civilians of the city, predominantly Muslim huddled inside the walls, trying not to think about the ravaging hordes outside, or what they would do if they ever got inside. They have heard horror stories, and the deserts were lined with the impaled bodies of their victims. They formed militias and assisted the defending armies however they could.
o	The Turks had sent parts of their own army to protect the area. They were the Islamic representative of this tri-religion alliance of sorts. Gathered together for the common defense of civilians, and protection of the holiest city in Islam.
o	An organized Jewish army group was also inside, gathered primarily from Jewish postliberals aligned with the Moralintern who saw some nobility in guarding the city of Mecca. The three sisters of the Abrahamic faith were packed shoulder to shoulder against the enemy outside.
o	Outside was the Godless State, a militant anti-theist state whose goal was the eradication of Islam, and eventually all religion. More than anything, they wanted to see the holiest city of Islam in ashes. They intended to torture and kill the pilgrims of Islam, seeing them as subhuman for their faith. But most of all, they knew the body and therefore DNA of Muhammad was inside of Mecca.
	By this point, genetic technology would allow them to bring Muhammad back from the dead. Their intention with him was basically to clone him a hundred times, and torture him for eternity. F---ing yikes.
o	Gathered under the moonlight of the day before the battle, a multi-faith religious service and prayer session was made just days before the battle began.
o	The siege lasted for weeks, then months. The Moralintern’s troops grew thinner and thinner, Turkey was unable to send any more assistance, as the Godless State completely surrounded the city, they were trapped with no reinforcements.
o	Attempts were made to contact the Catholic Church for help, but inconclusive answers were made.
o	Huddled around the inner city, they evacuated everyone they could. Civilians crowded around the Kabba, praying that God could save them from this living nightmare. The Moralintern-Jewish-Turkish coalition was pushed back further and further. On the eve of destruction, as they were finally pushed back to the Great Mosque of Mecca, turning it into a fortress, and setting up barricades across the church, they were ready to make their last stand. Muslims of all denominations prayed for rescue and salvation, and even Christians joined in to plead with their own God for help.
o	And from the West, a white horse came, an army of mostly Brazilian, Roman, and other Catholic soldiers had landed on the west coast of Arabia, coming to relieve them. Smashing into the Godless frontlines, the combined Moralintern, Turkish, Jewish, and local militia populations all attempted a breakout. Riding into battle, the forces of 4 armies beat back the wave of Godless soldiers. Drenched in blood and sweat, they led the ragged remnants of the pilgrim and refugee population towards the west, towards the sea, towards rescue.
o	But the second wave of Godless soldiers were incoming, and it was known then it was truly hopeless. The Godless State controlled the skies, and everyone knew all was lost. But there was still one thing they could do. The body of Muhammad was excavated, and quickly passed on from east to west, as the Godless state entered into the Holy Mosque of Mecca and set it all ablaze. The pocket was closing. Taking only the body of Muhammad and a motley 5 refugees, the last helicopter took off from Mecca, as the armies within prepared to face total annihilation.
o	The armies of Mecca stood their ground and made one last stand. Catholic, Muslim, Protestant, Jewish, Hindi, and Irreligious alike. It was total defeat, every single one of them were captured or slaughtered. In the coming days, every single person involved would be executed, the Moralintern peacekeepers were treated particularly harshly, as they had been the biggest thorn in the Godless State’s side. The surviving peacekeepers were kept alive and tortured for weeks, and finally their ragged bodies crucified just as their stories stated. The rows of crucified peacekeepers were visible for miles.
o	The desecration of Mecca sends shockwaves across the Islamic world. A surefire sign that Armageddon was coming. And a man known as the Mahdi was there. He and his followers were there, but managed to escape the Battle of Mecca. He saw as the holiest site in Islam burned, and he knew what he needed to do.
-	The Mahdi reveals himself after the desecration of Mecca, and begins creating his own state in Arabia, fighting the Godless State himself. His early victories against an enemy many times his size leads to growth in his legitimacy.
-	The Unionist vote is now consolidated under Tom Hirst and his party. With the old Jacksonists of Ryan Jackson retreating into the new Moralist Party. The Milintern is still firmly under the Unionists, however.
o	The Moral Purists are gaining more and more control over the new Moralist Party.
-	Mass outbreak of the “Last Hour War”. The Mahdi reveals himself, rallying an army and attacking the Moralintern base at Medina. The Moralintern pours all of its resources towards protecting its stronghold in Western Arabia, with both the forces of the Mahdi and the Godless state putting pressure on the front.
-	The Moralintern organizes a second Atlanta Declaration, having thrown in the towel of enforcing the first one in a world now swarming with transhumanism and artificial intelligence. As well as needing revisions. This time however, the Catholic Church does not attend, instead creating their own Rome Declaration. The Moralintern hosts an ecumenical meeting among Moralist Protestants, and this is what they cobble together. With transhumanist beliefs running rampant, and the need to balance between both the Civic Moralists and the Moral Purists, here is what they come up with.
o	Principle 0: Humanity as a pattern of information. They define humanity not by biology or by genetics, but instead as a pattern of information, a recognizable human form grounded in the idea of the Imago Dei. They fix Jesus Christ as Nazareth as the platonic ideal of the human being, and the reference point which all future humans should be measured against. Adam and Eve are also cited for more gender-specific ideals. “Human” by this definition is now defined as that which has the form of humanity.
o	Principle 1: Thou shalt not disfigure the human form. You shall not take something of the human form and genetically degrade it to something lesser than the deserved dignity for the human form. With the baseline human set as the line set for the minimum dignity for the human form. This outlaws heinous practices such as evolutionary regression, the creation of genetic abominations, or transhumanism as a form of torture.
o	Principle 2: In place of “No machine may rule over man”, they loosen that to “no machine may oppress man”. Though lacking the global firepower to enforce this belief, they state this as an internal principle, as well as a casus belli to topple opposing regimes.
o	Principle 3: Seeing the race to try and contain the rise of AI to be fruitless, and transhumanism giving the Moralintern weapons of their own to enhance human capability, “No Machine may supercede man” is replaced with “Man must supercede machines”. Believing they can make up the technological arms race with transhumanism.
o	Principle 4: Finally, “No machine may kill autonomously” remains unchanged. 
o	Principle 5: Though interestingly, it was noticed that they added on another clause, defining machines as not human, and that humans are not machines. This was an addition by some of the more transhumanist advocates for unknown reasons, and was allowed simply due to how straight forward it was.
	There is a loophole here. If a machine can be made to conform with the human form. With a recognizable human face, body, and soul, then they would qualify for the definition of human by Principle 0, and then no longer be recognized as machine, and freed from the jurisdiction by Principle 5. And they could not be unrecognized/reformed back into a machine, via Principle 1.
-	The Human Extinctionists create a version of FATES who is environmentally friendly.
-	Hirst attempts to run for a 4th term, but halted by Moralist candidate John A. Chesterton, who ran on a policy of a centrist, united front against Hirst, and “Moderate Moralist values”, common sense Christian values”. Just short of Roosevelt’s record of 4 terms, Hirst is finally halted after serving 3. Chesterton does however continue Hirst’s constructionist agenda. 
-	A mentally deranged, extremely racially mixed man near the collapsed region of South Sudan proclaims the “Final Empire”, where he claims to be rightful inheritor of every empire in history… Including the ones that were still around. So he claims to be the rightful successor of the British, Russian, German, Roman, Persian, American, Chinese, etc empires… Despite the fact that plenty of these empires were still around.
2153:
-	The Godless State goes on a rampage across Arabia, genociding anyone and anyone who they find to still be religious, or adhere to religious values. This causes the Tripartite Pact (A compact between the three nations of Zion, Turkey, and the Persian Technate) to intervene to try and stabilize the region. They don’t particularly care about the warcrimes, they just think it’s bad for regional stability.
-	John A. Chesterton attempts to send the Milintern back in to try and stabilize the world after the mess that was Hirst’s extended term. But the trust with the rest of the world had been severely burned, and American soldiers are attacked on sight.
-	Genetic drift was ongoing since the advent of mainstream transhumanism around the 2090’s, and the Immortal Era. But is very noticeable now, with humans not only fracturing into races, but different species.
-	South Africa has been relatively untouched by the great collapse caused by the Milintern Civil War, and as a result forms the Greater African Union, uniting with the remnants of Namibia, and Botswana to do so. They call themselves “Militant Progressive Afrohumanism”, not afraid to push back against a world that is fundamentally illiberal.
-	A number of the “Petty Fateah” organize into the Fatalist Consortium, essentially a network of FATES-derived AI to try and steer the world on a better direction. Unlike their “father”, these AI do tend to be better trained on morality and ethics, leading to better outcomes. Due to the open source nature of the FATES code, these AIs are embedded in everything from banking systems, to government algorithms, and everything. The Consortium conglomerates around a new ideology known as Utilitarian Materialism, an ideology similar to Utilitarianism or Effective Altruism. 
-	The Consortium would begin to manipulate the events of the world in accordance to their new ideology, which they believe to be maximizing humanity’s ultimate potential. They are however somewhat secretive and gatekeep-y, believing that smelly irrational humans should not be privy to their grand plans.
Bioprogressives:
Defined as radical embracement of transhumanism, with little or no limitations or restricting principles. These are essentially transhumanist libertarians.
-	Uplift Bands, roaming bands of uplifts republics, extremely animalistic, brutalist. Living in roaming bands constructing poetry in hard-to-reach mountainsides and other places, often live outside urban population centers and loot trash. Have outcompeted non-uplifted animals in feral bands. Conglomerate like organized crime or gangs.
o	Drift description: Much like their animalistic counterparts, but with a measurably much higher level of intelligence. Frequently outcompete animals when in contact. Slowly driving the native wildlife of Earth extinct. Interbreeding between the two groups is also demonstrably increasing the average intelligence of animal populations worldwide.
-	Therian/Furry Transhumanist Groups consisting of ex-humans who decided to augment themselves with animalistic traits. Sometimes retarding their own intelligence to downlift them to a more animalistic state. Extremely prone to violence and abuse, occasionally fights the Uplift Bands for resources. Both the Therians and bands of uplifted animals are most common in the inner cities, where there is the highest concentration of resources.
o	Genetic description: Wildly varying, form into unstable, violent gangs with abuse and mistreatment extremely common, both by human society and each other.
-	The Thousand Children, a global movement of transhumanists creating an amorphous, anarchic community, with their own leaders and moral codes.
o	Genetic description: Wildly varying, though less feral than the Therians. Lawless society with violent clashes often needed to settle disputes. Distrust of law enforcement.
-	Nations such as the Union of South Africa/Greater African Union have long been attractors for bioprogressive populations. As well as the Transhumanist Belt in India, Transhumanist Catalonia, and parts of East Asia. (South Korea, Taiwan.)
o	Genetic description: Varying, though even these countries normally have (somewhat lax) limits on the boundaries of transhumanism. Most common augmentations are related to pleasure, sex, and on occasion, productivity.
Alt-Biology/Bio-Alts:
Defined as having a single aspirational anchor point for transhumanism but set contrary to the idea of the human form. Or countries that set a different anchor point than the human baseline.
-	Japanese Shisutemu (System), where the guiding ideology is not about preservation of the human form, but instead the systematization of society, and the well functioning of society through systematic integration. All people are to be used as a cog in the greater service of a top down planned system, controlled by the Shisutemu Bureaucrats. (Homo sapiens shisutemu)
o	Genetic description: Higher boredom tolerance, endurance, obedience, lower creativity scores and independence.
-	Zion, where the guiding ideology is a kind of utilitarian survivalism. They will be integrated with anything and everything they might need, in order to ensure the survival of the Jewish nation. (Homo sapiens judaea)
-	Indian Brahmans were normally altered in order to better connect and interface with the Noosphere, turning them into one of the top hubs for Noospheric research, and making Indian skilled psychics a commodity in high demand.
o	Genetic description: Enlarged imagination and visual processing centers, more vivid dreams, longer sleep cycles. Much higher creativity and interpretation.
-	Transfeminists, who wish to eliminate the hold of men in the reproduction process, as well as make themselves as strong as possible. They glorify the strong female form, and normally take tons of steroids.
o	Genetic description: Much stronger muscle mass, built for combat.
-	Darwinists of all stripes normally augment themselves to be stronger at all means possible, sometimes creating what are known as “biomechanical hulks”, which are just meant to be the strongest soldiers
o	Genetic description: Creation of genetic abominations made for combat (Warhulks). Average person is given greater muscle mass.
-	The Human Extinctionist State wishes to “delift” humans back to a primitive state in order to save the environment, effectively a human extinction death cult that worships nature.
Bioconservatives/Atlantacists:
Often named after the document that sets down the foundations of their movement, the Declaration of Atlanta, Bioconservatives emphasize the preservation of the human form, normally recognized as a pattern of information. 
-	Biocons are normally split up further into purists and patternists. Split on whether they want to include things such as artificial intelligence and machines as humans. While Bioconservatives normally recognize the personhood of humanoid machines, it’s still heavily up to debate whether humanity is genetic, or an information pattern structure.
-	All bioconservatives agree on the preservation of the human form, and usually defining the human form around some kind of idea of baseline humanity, or off an idealized platonic being. Most Christian bioconservatives base their idea of the human form off the platonic ideal of Jesus Christ of Nazareth as their quintessential human.
-	The Moralists/Moralintern, the quintessential bioconservative faction. Originally purists, have now been forced into heavy patternism in order to moderate during the era of Tom Hirst. Writers of both the First and Second Declarations of Alexandria.
o	Genetic description: Official designation “Homo sapiens americanus”, generally increased capacity for empathy, creativity, and general intelligence. Sometimes described as being “child-like” and “naïve”.
o	The current Moralist Party is still divided on Moralist (Civic and Purists) and Jacksonist lines. With the Purists being more purist and the Civics being more patternist.
-	The Catholic Church are purists, whilst recognizing the personhood of artificial beings, does not grant them the title of human. Originally, they shared this perspective with the Moralintern, but have since diverged.
-	Most of the governments influenced by the Catholics or the Moralintern would fall under this umbrella as well. Including most of the New World, and various Christian countries part of the Anglophone diaspora. This includes the United States, Brazil, and others.
Biopuritans:
Those who reject transhumanism entirely and wish to preserve the biologically unaltered baseline humanity. Cultures under this umbrella usually have stigma against marrying or interbreeding with those outside of the biopuritan umbrella, in fear of “contaminating” the purity of the human race.
-	China is the largest example of this, with the country fiercely opposed to any attempts at contaminating the human race ironically being led by an AI with the same bioreactionary beliefs. The Han Chinese are seen to be a pure, blessed peoples who must remain pure at all costs, and preserve the memory of humanity as well as the lineage of the Yellow Emperor with them. They also discourage race mixing for this reason.
-	Hard Humanists of the Humanist Directorate.
-	The Warembo are known to be biopuritans.
-	Biopuritan communities in the United States and other Western countries. Including groups such as the Amish, Mennonites, Fundamentalist Baptists, and other such isolationist Christian communities. They organize under the Biopuritan League of America, and have their own lobbying group that gives them special exemptions from the Moralintern.
2154:
-	The Godless state is drawing in millions of disaffected anti-theists from across the Arab world, and sometimes outside the Arab world. The Tripartite Pact is having trouble keeping stability, as both Turkey and Iran are unable to fight a war of attrition at this scale.
-	Explosion of Neo-Fatalist Thought, driven by the destruction of the aftermath of the Milintern Civil War, the Ordered Spring, and the assistance of the Fatalist Consortium.
-	Southeast Asia has recovered from the Milintern Civil War, with PMCs such as the Aceh PMC and the Empire of Indonesia/Sons of Majahpahit rising as regional warlords in its place. Metanet de-facto still controls the capital of Jakarta, and most areas are held by regional governments or warlords.
-	As a reaction to the increasing anti-theist sentiment growing across the Arab World, various Utopian Muslims set off for Timbuktu, where they create the state of Jannah (AKA New Eden), based around Timbuktu off the ruins of the ex-Franco Sahelian Commonwealth. They’re financed by the remaining financial institutions of Africa, who agree to fund a mass terraforming project in the region.
-	The Greater African Union begins peacekeeping across the continent of Africa, thankfully alleviating some of the strain off the Moralintern. The Moralintern attempts to strike a cordial relationship, but the GAU’s tone is suspicious, if not hostile towards the Moralintern. They represent fundamentally different worldviews. Militant progressivism VS Christian Moralism. Many of the higher ups in the GAU are white progressive migrants from the United States, who have an irrational hatred for what the Moralists did.
-	China has successfully secured Tibet and Xinjiang. This, along with incursions into Myanmar and Laos means that the Chinese empire now has a larger extent than any time since the Yuan Dynasty. As well, China successfully pressures the Federation of the 7 Sisters to cede Arunachal Pradesh to China. The Chinese have successfully achieved all of their territorial claims from the early 21st century, except for one. With all of China finally under the command of the mainland once again, China seeks to reunite with its longest, and most contentious “lost province”.
-	John A. Chesterton, knowing this, increases American military presence over Taiwan. This greatly angers Taiwanese independence and Chinese nationalist populations in Taiwan, which has turned this into a three way conflict between Taiwanese, Chinese, and American for the future of the island.
-	The Empire of Brazil, finding their own chance to strike, begin border skirmishes over American Guiana, as well as having the Empire of Mexico act extra aggressive over its lost northern territories.
o	The two begin to realize their interests are quite aligned and make an agreement to begin cooperation. The Empire of Brazil also has religious reasons to take down the Protestant Americans.
2155:
-	Several Godless State attacks on humanitarian and refugee populations forces the Moralintern to intervene. With pre-existing bad blood already present between the two, the Moralintern commits all of their resources to fighting off the Godless State. With the Tripartite Pact of Turkey, Iran, and Zion are getting overwhelmed.
-	The Afghani Dawnstate capture the transhumanist regions of the Indus Valley, formerly the location of the Indus Ascendency. They’re put to good work, enhancing their transhumanism to an even further degree in their war against the Indians. Indian psychic brahmins are forced to deal with the use of transhumanist soldiers and war hulks.
-	With help from the Greater African Union, the Nigerian Civil War is finally concluded after 20 years of on and off stalemate. The West Nigerian Humanist Directorate and its allies in the United States of West Africa, and the broader Humanist Directorate are victorious. The Singularitarians retreat to the Singularity State. (Consisting of former Cameroon and the Central African Republic.) Where their Singularity AI frustratedly return to the drawing board.
-	Both the Singularity State and the Ordered State of France join the Fatalist Consortium. “Fatalist” in this case has now taken on the meaning of enlightened despotic rule by artificial intelligences. Broadly aligning themselves with the Consortium’s goal of maximizing utilitarian potentiality, they’re an easy fit into the organization.
-	The Chinese begin buying up influence in the Southeast Asian Pearl cities, one by one. These cities tended to be controlled by the wealth of Chinese oligarchs anyway, but JIN DUN wants to funnel that money back into investments in China, to catch up to the economies of the West, and especially the behemoth that is America. Southeast Asia de-facto becomes an economic satellite of China, and JIN DUN smiles as his plan to restore the Chinese hegemony over the world is progressing in accordance to plan.
-	South Korea has fallen to the Transfeminist Rebels, who proclaim the South Korean Gynocracy. Samsung has relocated to America, and the surviving reactionary movements have regrouped in North Korea. Who creates the Pure State of Korea.
-	The Pope declares the 10th Crusade against the Godless State, gathering a large number of Catholic Crusaders to attack the Godless State.
-	The Mahdi states that the “Armies of Rome” have come to fight in the Middle East, and that the final days are upon them.
Update on the state of space colonization.
-	By this point in the timeline, humanity has a population of tens of millions in space. Both Plymouth and Eden have been subsumed by the Lower Heaven Project, which now covers a land area the size of a small US state and has a population in the millions. Low Earth orbit is crowded with stations and even settlements and contains a majority of the stellar population.
-	The Moon has a population in the millions, with heavy automation needed to manage America’s massive shipbuilding industry. The average GDP per capita for the average American by 2150 is around 500k, while your average Lunarian American is a multimillionaire.
-	The Papal States have been rebuilt in low Earth orbit (Roman Constellation), and a few proper nation states have been built in orbit. Mostly startup nations in a similar fashion to seasteading.
-	Humans have now landed on Venus, Mercury, various Asteroids, and the Jovian Moons. Probes have been sent to neighboring star systems, and photos have been sent back from Breakthrough Starshot.
2156:
-	John A. Chesterton of the Moralist Party is able to win a second term, against Tom Hirst’s chosen ideological successor in the Patriotic Unionist Party. Hirst himself enters retirement, as public opinion sours on his term.
-	Both the Moralintern and the Milintern are abroad. The Moralintern dealing with the Godless State and trying to stabilize the Middle East, and the Milintern is in Africa, contracted there by the US Government and ordered to work together with the Greater African Union. The GAU gains respect for the Milintern there, and they bring back their ideology of militant progressivism back to the United States.
-	The Milintern sets up a belt of countries stretching from former Burkina Faso/Mali to Sudan in the former Sahel region, empowering local military elites. They weren’t democracies, but the Milintern doesn’t mind that much. Their first priority is stability, and they’ll work with whoever they need to work with.
-	The Utilitarian State of Czechia is formally declared, after a takeover by the Utilitarian Rationalist Foundation, now a front for the Asarinists. JIN DUN had eliminated a good amount of them, but not enough to prevent them from regrouping in the most secular country in Europe. Czechia begins advancing leaps and bounds ahead of other countries, citing their “dedication to utilitarian rationalist principles”. In reality, this is the knowledge of the Asarinists giving them a massive leg up.
o	Secretly, the Utilitarian Czechs are a front to begin funneling weapons to the Godless State. Alien Asarinist technology begins waging a war against the combined forces of the Tripartite Pact, Moralintern, and Catholic 10th Crusade.
-	The “Euronetwork” proposal begins between France, Belgium, the other Fatalist nations. To the resistance of the Milintern-aligned nations in the center of Europe such as Germany and Poland.
-	The Mahdi massively rises in prominence, after several near-supernatural battles where he fights off enemies outnumbered 10 to 1. He begins philosophizing theologically, creating a new branch of “Mahdist Islam”, saying this is the true original Islam taught by Muhammad. This borders on heresy very quickly, so the Mahdi is kept in check by his inner circle. Which included a brilliant military advisor, a brilliant domestic policy advisor, a wise Islamic imam, and the Mahdi himself, the charismatic leader who held the whole operation together.
-	The Mahdi creates a near utopian society where he lives, mediated by a great policy advisor, along with his theological and military advisor.
-	The 100-year anniversary of the start of the 4th World War. The scars have healed, and many veterans give speeches to commemorate the lessons of the war.
Militant Progressivism:
-	Progressivism cannot afford to be passive and tolerant. This is intolerant Progressivism, Hierarchal Progressivism, Unequal Progressivism. There are better cultures, there are better civilizations. Embraces the hierarchy of merit and the hierarchy of morality. Some people are just better than others.
-	In particular, they see cultures that promote equality, tolerance, and what could be called “progressive liberal values” as being superior to other cultures. Cultures that don’t do that are promoting what they call, to borrow a Moralist phrase, nittery.
-	Promotions the addressing of systemic inequalities within society, and gives a token position for those who exist outside of its framework. But most importantly, it demands that the progressive framework defend itself, and to aggressively assimilate those fall outside the framework, once they become a large enough threat.
-	This is their solution to the paradox of tolerance. They acknowledge that other cultures are often intolerant, and become intolerant to those who violate tolerance when they become a sufficiently large force to threaten them. Progressivism must have teeth, progressivism must have the ability to defend itself. They give up the idea of equality, embracing the idea of the hierarchy of morality and the hierarchy of merit.
-	They reject the demonization of strength, pulling from the old Jacksonists, they glorify strength. And they come to a decently similar conclusion to the Christian Moralists. They make it the duty and moral obligation of the strong to help the weak. And they glorify strength, for it will be the strong who have the ability to lift up the weak.
The Concert’s War (With 3 ex-Concert Great Powers involved)
2157:
-	With the Americans distracted everywhere, the Moralintern tied down in the Middle East, and the Milintern busy, the Chinese and Brazilians decide right now is the best time to strike. Skirmishes break out over American Guiana, Taiwan, and across the Mexican border. The entire Latin American alliance assembled by the Brazilians declares a crusade against the Americans. The Pope sanctions the conflict as a proper crusade against Protestantism.
-	Anti-Catholic sentiment skyrockets across the United States, nudging the balance of power towards the Moralists and Purists in the Civic Moralist Party. Religious zealotry blazes across the United States.
-	The Russians join the Americans in their time of need, and Chinese soldiers begin attacking Russian positions to retake Outer Manchuria. The stage is set. America and Russia against China and Brazil.
o	Populations at war: The United States: 2.81 billion. China: 2.34 billion. Brazil: 1.22 billion. Combined Latin American Coalition: 2.88 billion. Russian Federation: 500 million. 3.3 billion VS 5.3 billion.
-	This is the first instance of the US Army getting involved since the end of the 4th World War. Not the Moralintern, not the Milintern, the US military. And they have many new toys they want to test out. The first is a new form of warform, heavily hardened against communication jamming, making attrition an almost non-issue. The second is new psychic exoskeleton armor, psychically linked to individual soldiers. A mix of these two descend against the Latin American coalition, defeating the complete coalition forces of Latin America, and threatening Mexico City.
-	The Brazilian military were trying to survive mostly using numbers, as they were completely outclassed by the Americans in technology. That said, the combined military of China and their Latin American coalition had a major numerical advantage, so they just needed to hold on.
-	The Catholics and Protestants were in an awkward spot, fighting together in the Godless State but fighting each other across the Americas. The Moralintern signed an unspoken peace deal with the Catholic Church. Their governments may have been at war, but their first enemy was to take out the Godless State first.
-	Millions of Muslims begin pledging loyalty to the Mahdi, as he scores more and more victories, and he emerges as a figure of hope for the Islamic community. His movement grows to hundreds of millions, his army swells with devoted believers. His appearances are carefully coordinated by his inner circle, who are doing a top notch job for his PR.
o	Most prominently, the entire nation of Egypt swears allegiance to the Mahdi, and attacks the Tripartite coalition.
-	The Mahdi creates a holy state in the Levant, and millions of Muslims begin to move there to be a part of the battle at the end of days. The Isma’li Imamate tries to make a stand outside their city of Dar al-Hikma, but are completely devastated by the Mahdi’s fanatical soldiers. The Imam flees to the city of Baku, Azerbaijan, and denounces the Mahdi as a deceiver. The Mahdi’s policy advisor is killed, and the holy state in the Levant begins to degrade, as the Mahdi takes control himself, and is not as capable as the advisor he just lost.
o	The Hidden Imam is also sent to Azerbaijan. He’s effectively the Shia counterpart to the Mahdi, but is much less impressive.
-	The Brazilian military also becomes a way for young royals to rise their way up the royal house. The emperor makes a pretty controversial decision, he sends his sons out to war, the one who becomes the best military leader will end up succeeding him on the throne to the Empire. The king has seven kids. 5 of which are seriously competing for the throne.
2158:
-	Americans attempt to make a landing at the city of Xiamen. Extremely overconfident in the abilities of their technology, about 100 thousand American soldiers descend on the city of Xiamen, outnumbered ten to one. The landing is an unmitigated disaster, with all 100 thousand American soldiers being captured, though not before inflicting 2 to 1 casualties, much thanks to their advanced technology. Though the US military is strong, their best officers went into the Milintern or the Moralintern, who are fighting on other fronts.
-	Russian-American coalition forces try to hold the line against the much more numerically superior Chinese in Siberia. American reinforcements are arriving, and the Russian local knowledge of the geography and climate is of much use.
-	Space warfare kicks off, with the Constellation of Rome being attacked. There is a serious risk of the Pope being captured. A US military assault on the Throne of Rome orbital station required the Pope to be evacuated to Brazil, leaving in a literal orbital drop pod before the Americans properly secured the base. Various Brazilian and Chinese space stations are attacked, and the Americans are able to secure the entire Roman Constellation. They also destroy China and Brazil’s satellite communications, making the entire war a logistical nightmare for them.
-	The US has completely decimated the Chinese fleet, after destroying their satellite communications. US warships approach the East China Sea. The Second Battle of Xiamen, and the Battle of Shenzhen sees the United States successfully secure a beachhead in China, hopefully to alleviate pressure off the Northern Front.
-	Meanwhile in Siberia, the Chinese have advanced to the borders of the American Siberia Colony, pushing a united Russia-American alliance back with superior numbers.  The US is trying to funnel in everything they can, but the Chinese have raw numbers.
-	The Mahdi routes and slaughters a majority of the entire Godless Army, doing in one night what the Moralintern couldn’t do in decades. It is said a great sandstorm arose at the center of the battle, blinding his enemies while his own soldiers were protected. Moralintern soldiers who listened to his sermons were prone to defect, he was just that charismatic. The Mahdi gains a genuine supernatural aura.
o	Behind the scenes, the Mahdi was not just a charismatic man, he was later revealed to also be a potent psychic, though he wasn’t aware of the fact, and later Mahdist Islams would try to conceal this fact. And the sandstorm? Incredible coincidence.
-	The Mahdi’s theological advisor is killed, causing the Mahdi to spiral closer and closer to Islamic heresy, and getting dangerously close to contradicting the Quran, something very very dangerous. Thankfully, the Mahdi is able to give an explanation and harmonize the two teachings every time.
2159:
-	The US has pushed into Southern China but are having extreme difficulty trying to hold the terrain in the hot, jungle climate, as well as the extremely militant local population. Some of the locals remember the South Chinese Republic, and are sympathetic to the ideas of American democracy, but most are nationalists who try their best to drive the Americans off their land. This becomes a quagmire on the level of Vietnam.
-	This does however force the Chinese to halt the advance in Siberia, as troops need to be called back to the Chinese South. The US Military is out of shape and needs better leadership, they begin poaching leadership from the Moralintern and Milintern to help them fight their wars, as they have more and better experience. The Moralintern is however much more used to fighting light skirmishes against rebel groups, not heavy, mechanized industrialized warfare. The Milintern is much better suited for the latter.
-	The Afghani Dawnstate has spilled into the North Indian Plains, as Egalist rebels from the south also begin capturing territory. The Indians have no choice but to begin adopting war hulks, retooling their warrior caste to become these genetic abominations.
-	JIN DUN begins piloting massive swarms of automated drones to attack American ships and soldiers while the Americans use laser-based defense systems to try and shoot down drones. Both sides make heavy use of augmented reality systems as well as redundancy systems. American jamming technology gets better and cripples Chinese drone capacity temporarily.
-	The Americans bulldoze over the united Latin American forces like a knife through hot butter, threatening to take Mexico City. The US has total space superiority so long as they have the Moon. JIN DUN realizes this, and begins getting ideas. Millions of dollars begin flowing towards American election campaigns.
-	The ceremonial caliph of Turkey is assassinated by Mahdi-affiliated terrorists, calling them a traitor to the Islamic faith for siding with Israel and against the holy messenger of the Mahdi. The Turkish government for what it’s worth does not recognize this Mahdi, following more traditional Sunni Islam, as well as progressive secularism.
-	The Mahdi continues his campaign, unifying the entire Arabian peninsula, capturing Basra as well as Yemen. His army is weakening, with both the Moralintern and the armies of Rome wearing down his army of millions. But finally the Mahdi proclaims the site of the final battle: the city of Jerusalem.
-	Worn down by Moralist and Catholic forces, Zion prepares everything it has for the battle located in the holiest city of Judaism. Enormous missile strikes rain down on Zion, rendering the country heavily wounded. Huge skirmishes around the city of Jericho see clashes between the armies of Zion and the armies of the Mahdi. Unfortunately, the Mahdi has just lost his genius military advisor, but is convinced he can still pull it off without them.
2160:
-	The battle of Jerusalem begins. Tripartite, Zionist, Catholic, and Moralist forces all come together for a defense of the city. Trying to safeguard as many of the holy sites as possible, including the Western Wall, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. GOLEM allocates all the resources he can into the defense of the city.
o	Moralists: "Wow, I find it really touching you're willing to defend something not holy to your faith." 
o	Zionists: "Of course we are. Do you have any idea how much money we make from American tourists? Defending this church is a no-brainer economic decision."
-	The battle is brutal and bloody, with the Mahdi coming in with an army 4 times the size of the coalition’s. But due to rigid discipline from the Moralists, good planning from GOLEM, and the general disorganized nature of the Mahdi’s army, they managed to route them. In the fleeing chaos, the Zionists are miraculously able to surround the Mahdi, trapping him and a segment of his army. The Mahdi is held up for several weeks in a prolonged siege underground in the city of Amman.
-	JIN DUN manages to convince the Indonesian warlords, the Sons of Mahjahpahit to sell them Indonesia’s immense former navy, and hire them as mercenaries to use it to harass the American navy. The Indonesian navy was likely the only one capable of standing up to the American one, and the American navy is badly damaged by the confrontation, at the cost of the complete destruction of the Indonesian navy, oh well, JIN DUN has bought himself a little more time.
-	During this time, the Mahdi preaches to his closest confidants. His advisors are dead, but he is convinced that he can still turn this war around. Driven insane by the toll of the war, went out on the surface. He was giving a passionate sermon at the time, as a Zionist drone spotted him. His last words were: “Praise be to God. To God I owe everything. Remember, the most important thing in this life is-”, literally getting killed mid-sentence. His followers would forever argue about his last words.
-	The Death of the Mahdi sends shockwaves across the Islamic World. Not believing the death of the Mahdi was something that was even possible. The Middle Eastern nuclear exchange begins, and the Mahdists refocus themselves on an even more aggressive annihilation of Israel, blaming them for the death of the Mahdi.
o	Zionist response: “3-0 on the Abrahamic Prophets. L.”
-	The Civic Moralist Party has grown to be THE establishment party, after the disaster that was Hirst and his personality cult, the Unionists have fallen by the wayside, leading to Civic Moralist hegemony in all 3 parts of the government. However, with them having ruled for 8 years, resentment towards them as the uniparty has increasingly grown, with even the Moralintern declining to endorse them, in fact coming out rather sharply against them for being too centrist. With the duopoly broken and the Unionist Party having fallen apart and unable to challenge them, numerous other parties ride a wave of anti-establishment discontentment to the office.
o	A secondary factor is the fact that transhumanism has become a front of mind, headline issue. And under the weight of obvious genetic inequalities, the Jacksonist idea of “colorblindness” became impossible to maintain. Division rises in the United States, as well as the rest of the world.
-	The African Singularity State declares the state of “Beoko-Ummoja”, or double unity. (As Beoko and Ummoja is the word unity in two different languages) They attempt an experiment to turn humans into a collective hivemind, fusing with the great AI that now runs the state, known as “The One”. This is furiously condemned by bioconservative organizations such as the Moralintern.
-	Major states in Central Africa begin recognizing uplifts as citizens, even carving out their own independent nations known as “Uplift Sanctuaries” and giving them the right to vote. Research on the actual intelligence of uplifts is heavily restricted. This is part of a new movement known as Pan-Sophontism, that believes in the ascension of all life.
o	This is decried by the Moralintern as an “abomination”.
-	In a major upset, the American Egalist Party wins in the first time, with new candidate Julia Turner making it to the presidency. She successfully rallied the Tom Hirst youth vote to switch parties, promising populism, massive increase in infrastructure projects, and major crackdown on economic monopolies. Most prominently, she wishes to go after the Lunar manufacturing oligarchs, threatening the position of the established interests there.
2161:
-	The Mahdist forces were in pure desperation mode. With the loss of their leader, and no solid direction but rage, they were going to lash out as much as they can against the Zionists. The Zionists are able to locate and demolish their entire fleet, which had been running on poor maintenance for 6 years.
-	The Mahdist forces, and what survives of the Godless State arrive at the same war tactic. With few resources remaining, and a decent amount of psychic knowledge, they begin flushing out the Noosphere for spirits, causing them to possess psychic avatars, and sending them against the front lines. These psychic entities act smug at first, but they are nowhere near ready for the horror of industrialized warfare.
-	They also take out every loan in the country, completely stripping out the copper wire and selling everything that wasn’t bolted down for another assault on Zion’s borders. They straight up going door to door, taking all the money, stealing everything that wasn’t bolted down, systematically dismantling the entire Middle East in every region they occupied, selling them, turning it into rockets, and lobbing it at Zion. As you can imagine, the businessowning and merchant classes of the Middle East began leaving rapidly after that.
-	With President Julia Turner now in office, the first thing she does with support from an Egalist Congress, with support from Primrose Moralists and Hirst Unionists to begin an investigation to break up the Lunar monopolies. She increases welfare and increases redistribution efforts towards the American peoples, much to the dismay of more market-oriented Civic Moralists. Turner also has a more reconciliatory approach towards the Chinese, probably because she’s a left-leaning Egalist, buying the Chinese precious time to regroup.
-	The 15 Great Families of Luna meet up in secret to discuss counteracting President Turner, in what becomes known as the first meeting of OLEC. (Organization of Lunar Export-Oriented Countries) They pledge support to the already pre-existing Lunar Nationalist Movement. 
-	With the collapse of Indonesia, anime makes a migration again. From Japan to Indonesia, it now worms its way into China. Indonesian animation studios set up shop in China and rapidly become China’s top cultural export. This gives JIN DUN an additional cultural lever to pull, at least as soon as they finish this war with the Americans. JIN DUN creates a simple AI-chatbot named Rui-chan, an anime girl who reads out the news. She becomes a hit.
-	The Chinese condemn the rising transhumanism around the world, in fact taking an even harsher stance than the bioconservative Americans. JIN DUN declares the need to keep the race of the Han people “pure”, somewhat ironic as he is an AI. But he elaborates “I am an AI, I am not human. My job is to serve China, to serve humanity. We must not confuse what it means to be human, and I condemn in the highest possible terms the creation of these genetic abominations”. And then he completely restricts genetic modification around the country. Uplift International publishes a map of where it is safe for uplifts to travel, and where it is not. People say these uplifts are human-like… But many sense something is inherently off.
2162:
-	The Tripartite Pact slowly pushes the Mahdists out of the Levant and Mesopotamia, with the 2nd generation of leadership of the Mahdist State not nearly being as competent as the first. The Mahdists are now fracking the entire Noosphere of spirits, slapping them into hastily constructed flesh and metal avatars, and throwing them at the enemy in massive waves. At first the spirits taunted the humans for coming to them for help. Later they screamed in horror, begging for mercy against the horror of industrialized warfare.
o	The Asarinist Czechs were partially responsible for giving the Godless state this technology, and allowed them to utterly frack the Noosphere for psychic entities, dragging them kicking and screaming into the physical world, before getting them shredded by industrialized warfare.
-	The Mahdi’s second in command ends up being a pretty competent military commander in his own right and begins organizing his vast armies for a campaign of revenge against Zion. He has much less focus on building a long-term caliphate, with his mindset effectively being “What do I need to think long term for? The world is ending.”
-	Start of the Lunar War of Independence, the Oligarchs of Luna decide to protest the new restrictions, to which President Turner opens fire on one of the Oligarchs. This is later mythologized as foundational mythology for Lunar identity, the assassination of Anne Lovejoy, the striking down of one of the 15 founding families. (Later they would turn it into a more romanticized depiction.)
-	The Lunar War of Independence causes a swell in fierce Lunar identity and badly disrupts America’s supply chains in space. America loses a major part of their dominance in space. The Battle of Lilian Reach becomes a major event in the Lunar Identity. 
-	The Afghani Dawnstate captures the city of New Delhi, creating the Greater Indian Dawnstate with Afghani Rulers as the warrior elite. North India becomes absorbed into this new state, while Egalist and Psychic Nationalist Rebels in the South vie for control of Southern India.
-	His closest confidents begin re-explaining that the death of the Mahdi marked the beginning of the end of the world. And that the millennial caliphate had been created. And that they were now waiting for his return. Retroactively rewriting history so they can explain the death of their prophet.
-	China attempts a large cyberattack against the American electrical systems, but found that they have largely switched to non-online redundancy systems. The Chinese are losing badly against the Americans, and they have to figure out a way to do disproportionate damage. JIN DUN realizes he really messed up, and as a result has to damage control this as a defensive war. Thankfully, given American boots are on the ground, and the centralization of Chinese propaganda networks, it was not hard to do so.
-	American soldiers land in and attack Shanghai, a megacity with a population approaching 30 million.
-	The US is now spending much of its resources creating an army that can land on and besiege the Lunar colonies, many advances in extraterrestrial combat were made here, as this was the first major conflict ever fought over a celestial body outside of Earth. The Moon has a 10:1 cost advantage over the Earth, so the Moon just needs to build enough ships to counter the US space fleet.
-	The Empire of Brazil attacks and destroys Kennedy Space Center, and uses its navy to bombard and cripple American space capability, as well as destroying the American space headquarters in American Guiana. 
2163:
-	The sons and daughters that the Emperor of Brazil sent to war all graduate from officer school, and are sent out with their legions to defend Mexico City. They’ve earned the loyalty of their men. Their main purpose is to both learn combat, but also to boost morale. The Americans, realizing they have 5 prime hostages to capture to help end the war, immediately massively intensify the conflict there, but also have strict orders not to kill, in order to take them as a bargaining chip. The Emperor is of course aware that the US will try to take them hostage, but knows that the US is a generally civilized nation, that won’t mistreat them.
o	Pablo (Aggressive, highly intelligent, and straight forward.)
o	Vincent (Hot headed, but determined. Diehard loyalty of his men.)
o	Rosa (Insecure, determined, imposter-syndrome. Knows she is at a disadvantage, being a woman. She wasn’t even supposed to be here, but she forced her way in, looking to be the one for the throne. Works 3x as hard, workaholic machine person.)
o	Romeo (So crazy he’s genius, psychic with near supernatural luck.)
o	Fredrico (Spymaster. Master of social deduction. Media manipulator more than anything.)
o	Sonia (Disqualified due to being female. Is just trying to give her siblings moral support.)
o	Nina (Disqualified due to being female. Youngest daughter, everyone is protective of her.)
-	Romeo is captured immediately, being taken into an American POW camp. Negotiations begin between the US and the Empire of Brazil for his release. Of course, as an extremely high-profile royal, he’s treated quite well. A coalition of Latin American countries successfully make a defensive stand at the Battle of Mexico City, delaying the American advance.
-	Some Brazilians figure out how to short-circuit America’s new psychic exoskeleton armor, activating a psychic-EMP of sorts, causing thousands of Americans to be crushed to death under the weight of their exoskeleton armor. All exoskeletons are recalled to be redesigned, warform warfare becomes even more prioritized, Brazilian soldiers mow down hordes of American warforms, but they’re meant to be mass produced and cheap.
o	The US deploys “rolling fortresses”, where teams of trained pilots are put to sleep and made to pilot large swarms of warforms. The warforms serve as a kind of armor around the rolling fortress, which is kind of a futuristic larger tank.
-	In China, they receive information how to short-circuit America’s exoskeleton armor as well, and a great wave of unrest goes out across the Chinese South. The US gets bogged down in mass-urban guerrilla warfare, and is having difficulty occupying all that land.
-	Several battles on the Lunar Surface between American and OLEC forces. The American economy is suffering without the megaproject spending and the space mining industry that relies heavily on Lunar foundries, though war spending currently makes up for it.
-	The war stalls, with the United States unable to take any more land, with both Mexico and Southern China bogging them down. Though much of the Chinese and Brazilian armies have been weakened, with half of Latin America’s armies being completely decimated, and the Chinese navy being completely destroyed, it seems increasingly unlikely that the US can win this war. Both the Chinese and Latin American coalition refuses to surrender.
-	The Darwinists in both Ursh Babylon and the Sapiens Republic decide this is a good time to jump Russia. With the United States holding down the Siberian front, and trying to fend off Chinese advances further into Siberia, the US now has another front to worry about. Shortly afterwards, Ursh Babylon, the Sapiens Republic, the Afghani Dawnstate, and the Indian Dawnstate all join as well.
-	The Post-Mahdists begin tapping into a realm known as the Nowhere, seemingly a lost fragment of a previous universe. This essentially drains the entire region of its psychic entities, and unleashes a massive demonic incursion across the Middle East. One which needs to be brutally put down, leading to mass desolation of the local Noosphere, leading to Noospheric sickness. Noospheric density can be thought of similarly to air density. And you will get much the same effects from both.
-	As the world becomes more unstable, US company Utopian Foundries (Think future SpaceX) begins constructing their own private owned space habitat, and begin selling out plots of land to the highest bidder.
2164:
-	The Metaverse Admin returns, as the Metaverse is overwhelmed by psychic, demonic, and digital entities, he destroyed the world one last time, holding up his part of the bargain, and setting his daughter free. The Metaverse begins to unravel, and the players log out one by one, as the entities breach in the Inner Walls. The admin stares at his daughter, the first time they have talked in years. She was asleep, but now, if only for a few minutes, she is fully lucid. Like a person gaining terminal lucidity on the verge of death. Her last words: “Thanks for playing with me, even if just a little longer”, and the Metaverse collapses.
o	This causes the Metaverse across all of the Pearl Cities to collapse with it. Completely destroying the economy of Southeast Asia. And the Pearl Cities go dark, one by one. Yet another one of the pillars of the old world have died.
-	President Turner knows her approval rating is going down, and she is unlikely to win the next election. So, in a bid to win the war, she tries an extremely aggressive and desperate move. She orders an extremely risky, and reckless attack on every country at once. She orders a direct attack by sea on the capital, or largest cities of all countries involved. She hopes such an overwhelming show of force can rejuvenate her popularity, and maybe even end the war. The cities targeted are Beijing, Rio, Mexico City, and a mass bombing of almost every country involved, readying the power of the US Air Force. She pulls out all the stops, even hiring the Milintern to bomb every target they’re able to. The operation is set for October, just before the next election. Though the US military is technologically powerful, they are lacking in leadership, generally devolving into a series of yes-men who was too proud of their firepower advantage. She is given a 50% chance of success, and it goes forward.
-	A grand offensive south from Siberia causes the Chinese to be pushed back to the borders of Manchuria, and Russian soldiers enter into Manchuria proper.
-	Operation Obsidian Globe goes forward, with simultaneous attacks on Tianjin, Sao Paulo, Gujarat, Mexico City, to knock out the countries of China, Brazil, India, and Mexico respectively. Enormous logistical muscle was put into this mission, and the exoskeletons were upgraded to be more resilient to psychic jamming, as well as be structurally sound enough for their operators to get out in case it broke.
o	Romeo managed to escape one day before the operation. He had been using his psychic powers to spy on the Americans the entire time, tracing the patterns in the walls and the air. He steals a copy of the plans and escapes from prison. Once there, he rushes back to the Empire of Brazil, with no time remaining for any of the countries left to prepare adequate defenses. All he knows about is the attack on Rio (Now the capital of Brazil), and “a bunch of other stuff”. He has no idea the sheer scale of the operation he had uncovered.
o	The day began with a massive bombing campaign of all countries involved, just hours before the start of the operation. A massive cyberattack takes down much of China’s digital infrastructure, delaying their ability to coordinate. India’s power system goes completely offline, though the Darwinists are more than capable of fighting in harsh conditions. A mass swarming campaign was done over Brazil, eliminating hundreds of anti-air batteries located around the city of Rio in the dead of night using stealth bombers.
o	The landings began in the early morning American time, when the sun had barely peaked out from the clouds. The Royal Legions were called to mount a defense of their home country. Despite a valiant defense, they’re forced to retreat, and Rio falls to the Americans, with the royal family and the Pope evacuating to the city of Brasilia.
o	In Tianjin, they’re met by fierce Chinese resistance, with JIN DUN deploying every soldier he can to the frontline, and another force from Southern China marching north to capture Beijing. JIN DUN evacuates to his backup compound deep underground in the center of China, abandoning his position in Beijing.
o	In Gujarat, they’re faced with extremely fierce Darwinist Afghani fighters, potentially the toughest soldiers ever trained by humans. They’re joined by the Sikh legion, who mount a defense of their country. The Darwinists are enhanced by countless transhumanist modifications, quite literally ripping normal soldiers to shreds, and denting and breaking America’s expensive exoskeleton armor. The warhulks they brought in find themselves able to tank bullets from tanks. But the Americans still clear out the beaches and make a dash for New Delhi.
o	A THEON strike levels a major mountain in Afghanistan, thought to contain much of the Afghani Dawnstate’s leadership. The Afghani Dawnstate descends into quarrelling warlords. This would be condemned by the international community, but this point, the Concert of Terra has completely collapsed, with 3 of the top 5 of the Council of 5 having collapsed, and the remaining 2 at war with one another. The Dawnstate would eventually find new leaders however, and the state would reorganize with the new pecking order established.
o	In Mexico City, a tidal wave of American armor and firepower crashes against the Latin American defenders, the combined armies and resources of an entire continent. The battle if brutal, crashing into one another until one side breaks under the weight of fiery carnage. It is here the infamous battle of the warforms occur, where both sides had mastered warform warfare, and had both sides do massive spam. More than 10 million warforms were destroyed in one day. But the Americans eventually take the city.
-	By election day, Turner still hadn’t done enough to win the election, with the Civic Moralists calling for a “return to normalcy”. President Tom Buchanan is elected. Turner is determined to win the war by the time her presidency was over, forces the American forces to get even more aggressive, setting the new deadline of January 6th.
-	The Americans push extremely aggressively and reactively, capturing much of Southern Brazil, Mexico, and Northern China, but getting bogged down in India, and getting repelled at the battle of Beijing. Turner orders them to keep attacking, in a series of increasingly rash and suicidal attacks, until the American officer core completely revolts, and retreats refusing to continue this any further. Much of the American strength was expended in this attack, and the US is driven out of all of the major powers, with operation Obsidian Globe a resounding failure.
2165:
-	New President Tom Buchanan comes into office, sees the ridiculous amount of money Turner had agreed to pay the private military corporations, and says no, demanding a renegotiation. When the PMCs refuses, Buchanan cuts off their funding. There is one thing you do not do, and that is mess with the army’s budget. Riding off a massive wave of military and veteran satisfaction, Sergeant Blackburn, a hero of the Taiwan War, and CEO of a major PMC, rallies together the rest of the Milintern and calls for a march on Washington DC. This becomes known as the Mercenary Revolt, or the start of the 2nd American Civil War.
-	The Milintern captures several state buildings, swearing their allegiance to the new Milintern government, much of the disaffected military joins them, forming a new confederation of states in the West of the country, capturing most of the mountain states, the Pacific Northwest, and the Rust Belt. From their home base in Chicago, they begin their march on Washington DC. The Loyalist States include the lone state of California, and a rough crescent stretching from Texas to New England. The Militarists had had enough of the US government, and the Moralists have to desperately cobble together a defense. The US Military is in shambles, as entire divisions had defected after the disastrous presidency of Julia Turner. The Moralintern, who just got finished dealing with the nightmare of the Last Hour War was hurriedly transported back to the United States. Julia Turner is f---ing captured and lynched.
-	The Moralintern and the Milintern fight in the streets. The Loyalists have a serious disadvantage, as much of the military firepower defected over to the Mercenary Revolt. But they do have a secret weapon, they have the common support of the people, while the Homeland Militias had not done anything yet, they would soon.
-	President Buchanan quickly signs a white peace deal with Luna, recognizing their independence in exchange for letting them import raw resources to deal with this civil war. This is recognized as Lunar Independence Day.
-	While the American frontlines collapse worldwide, Brazil, China, India, etc scramble to retake lost land. Even disorganized, the American soldiers put up a stubborn resistance, and continue resisting the Chinese, preventing them from taking cities like Shanghai.
-	Mexico recaptures the city of Mexico City.
-	Several pitched battles take place on American soil, usually just the militaries fighting the government. The people are primarily on the side of the Loyalists, and though many were at first sympathetic towards the plight of the veterans, opinion sours as this brings devastation to American soil. Many soldiers begin to defect from the Mercenary side.
2166:
-	The Chinese hurriedly rushes for Taiwan, landing as many soldiers as they can and securing the island at last. With the US focused on the civil war, they take this opportunity to capture it. Meanwhile, Mexico tries to push into Northern Mexico, to be met with fierce resistance from Homeland Militias set up by Northern Mexicans, who have now assimilated idea of the United States. Kaliningrad declares independence from the United States and falls under the control of the Union of Germany.
-	Realizing his time is running out, Blackburn rallies together the Milintern and charges at Washington DC, where he is harassed and attacked constantly by local Homeland Militias and unsympathetic peoples. He fights several pitched battles with the Moralintern, who slow him down on his march on Washington DC.
-	The strongest available Loyalist army fights the entire Mercenary Army outside Washington DC, with both sides being mostly evenly matched. Two ruined armies remain at the end of the battle, though the Mercenary army won. But at this point, the people have had enough. Blackburn, trying to proceed further south towards Washington DC, finds himself increasingly harassed by the locals, and a pitched battle between the Homeland Militias of West Virginia and Maryland, and the Blackburn PMC coalition. 
-	Eventually, the mercenary coup is worn down by the American people themselves, and he is brought to Washington DC in chains. In a great ceremony, Blackburn is handed over to the Loyalist government, and power is symbolically transferred from the people to the government. But due to this, the people are now more bold about asserting that they are the true power in the United States.
-	Much of the US military was destroyed, with the Milintern being completely dissolved, and half the US military having defected or deserted. Not wanting to persecute a huge number of disillusioned young men with combat training, and finding their reason for desertion to be frankly quite reasonable, Buchanan pardons all the deserters but not the traitors. Blackburn is set to hang.
-	With the US military in a severely weakened state, and the US needing to engage in reconstruction, the US engages with peace talks with the other powers. They cede Taiwan to China, and they sign a white peace with Brazil. Later on, the Moralintern would crush the Ursh Babylonian rebellion, and a ceasefire returns once more with the Darwinist powers.
-	Reconstruction begins in the United States, with about a quarter of the economy having been destroyed in the conflict. The Milintern is officially dissolved, and new military corporations are eventually created to serve the American military industrial complex needs.
o	Jacksonism by this point is a functionally dead ideology. The Moralists are in charge now, and top on their priority is the moral panic against transhumanism.
-	Pablo is selected as next in line for the throne in the Empire of Brazil. Though all of the 5 competing were acknowledged as being essential in their defense of the motherland.
2167:
-	Reconstruction in the United States, and a drop in standards of living radicalizes the population. The “Sons of Adam”, a radical human supremacist organization finds its root in the United States, while more conservative states see an uptick in discrimination against America’s (relatively small) uplift population. The Adamist movement is strongest in the country of Great Britain however, with a much larger uplift population having taken over major cities such as Manchester and London.
-	During the war, the bioconservatives finish their takeover of the Moralist Party/Moralintern, and Tom Buchanan renames it the Providence Conservative Party, a three-legged stool of bioconservatism, technocratic (techno-optimist), and Christian theocratic interests. In a way you can think of this as an echo of the neoconservative coalition, but now against bioprogressivism rather than communism.
-	Academia, controlled by the Christian Forwardists begin publishing paper after paper about the effects of transhumanism, and the differences between groups of people. These papers are misinterpreted and used to fuel extreme racism. racism begins making a comeback, and the Jacksonist ideology shatters, now that one of its core tenants: Equality and colorblindness was now functionally impossible.
-	The US empowers the Moralintern to enforce persecute violators of the Moralintern’s genetic purity laws. In exchange, the Moralintern left American politics, instead becoming America’s genetic enforcement arm. The Moralintern Gene Court is set up, and the Inquisition is sicc’d on the population to enforce compliance.
o	The Moralintern releases the “Human Trifecta”, a triangle denoting the 3 corners of the acceptable “human form”. Adam, Eve, and Christ. With Adam and Eve as the baseline, and Christ as the pinnacle on top.
-	With enough time finally having passed, the Jesusland colony is revived under ideological and scientific reasons. The discovery of the Martian Noosphere invites Moralist universities to set up a large research colony on the colony, as well as thousands of religious Christians to move in. The asteroid of Deimos has also been heavily colonized, where it serves as the anchor point for the Deimos Skyhook. Gehenna is set up as a Martian version of the Omnithecia and Gnosis Station.
o	Something is wrong with the Martian Noosphere. It’s… Far too large relative to the human population on Mars. Noospheric sizes scale proportionately to the number of people who live there.
o	As well, the Noosphere is… Strange. It’s not human.
-	By this point, the Moralists have completely ousted the Jacksonists from the institutions, as no new Jacksonists are being made, and a generation has now passed, with the Moralists being the only ones with experience running large institutions. With neither the Hirstians, progressives, nor others having living experience with this.
o	The Moralists kickstart the denomination revivalist movement, trying to create more internal denominational differentiation to foster a sense of division to avoid complacency. The Moralists divide themselves into their respective denominations. The Methodists, the Baptists, the Presbyterians, the Petersonians, the Psychedelics, the Pentecostalists, the Forwardians, the Ascensionists, the Spiritualist Movement, and the Non-Denominational Movement.
-	The Moralintern creates the Ecumenical Union, an Ecumenical, Pan-Christian alliance that extends outside of the normal paradigm of Christian Moralism. More relevantly, this alliance features more representation from Orthodox, Fundamentalist Protestants not swayed by Christian Moralism, as well as Catholicism.
-	The 100th anniversary of the Day of Nuclear Hellfire.
2168:
-	American Transhumanism Scare goes global, reaching a fertile audience worldwide. All across Europe, building resentment towards uplifts and radical transhumanists is finally vocalized, and finally erupt now given tangible form. The Catholic Church quickly rushes to catch up to the Moralintern, referencing their own previous documents such as the Anima Humanae to update their transhumanism policy. And all of it is being fueled by China, who is taking advantage of the American transhumanism scare to propagate biopuritanism, and fuel a global backlash against radical transhumanism.
o	The world gets split into two, which increasingly see each other as antagonistic. The bioconservatives, who wish to preserve the human form, and the bioprogressives, who stand against the moral panic and more often than not, defend transhumanist rights.
-	A viral news story emerges of a rogue transhuman killing and eating people’s children due to a faulty pair of genetics. You can already feel the spin by both sides. “Deepfake! Fake News! Coincidence! Just one incident in a world of billions!” the bioprogressives cry. “Murder! Widespread! None of our children are safe!” the bioconservatives cry. The Great Scare rises. The story was confirmed to be real, later on.
-	The Inquisition swells in numbers, as does groups such as the Seeds of Adam, who begin harassing and persecuting transhumans in large numbers. Though do note, over 95% of the population of the United States had at least some genetic augmentation. The threshold is transhumanism is unclear and all over the place. Only the most visible and “freakish” are targeted at first.
o	With no other choice, the Moralintern Gene Court is forced to begin reviewing the thousands of subspecies in the United States and manually approving them one by one. They essentially recreate the US Patent Office or maybe the FDA approval office, but now for transhumanist species as opposed to patents or drugs. They first mark off homo sapiens. That was clearly fine, and then officially stated that basic enhancements and “immortality augmentations” were fine. That knocked out about 90% of the human population. Next was just to slowly sort out the remaining 10%. They decree that no transhumanist surgery, that doesn’t count as “baseline healing” (Which they define as getting closer to the baseline of Adam and Eve) can be done without the consent of the person involved. This also locked “aspirational” transhumanism (That which was meant to uplift or improve one’s life, akin to cosmetic surgery) away from minors.
o	Their criteria: Cruelty. Is the augmentation cruel to the user? Assimilation. Can this augmentation assimilate into human society? Productivity. Productivity, the modification should not make the person a burden upon society. Long term survival, is the species viable long term? Preservation of the Human Soul, basically preserving the human form, as recognizable to baseline humans. And finally, Moralintern discretion, to cover any gaps they might have missed.
o	These species can be given certain rulings. 
	Endorsed, meaning the government will cover the cost of genetic surgeries to transition into this species. 
	Legalized, meaning it is legal, but not subsidized. 
	Sent back for Review, stating that a species is almost alright, just asking them to make some tweaks. 
	Rejected: Assimilation Order, where the species is illegalized, and entire population of that species is to undergo mandatory species transition either to a baseline human form, or some legalized human form of their choosing. 
	Rejected: Deportation Order, where the species is deemed to not be fit to live within the borders of the United States, and are to be deported to some region determined later. 
	And finally, Rejected: Extermination Order. Where the species is deemed so cruel, or such a danger to humanity, and where a transitioning back to normal humanity is deemed impossible, that the Moralintern will send in peacekeepers to systematically hunt them down.
o	Similar systems are adopted all over the world. America just happens to be ahead of the curve on this.
-	The Moralintern declares a “War for the Human Condition” in front of their Atlanta headquarters. Global opinion of the Moralintern plunges, especially in Africa. American support for the Moralintern solidifies. The Moralintern and their “War for the Human Condition” starts out at a 72% approval rating.
-	Buchanan is elected for a second term. A mass transhumanist exodus begins. This is expected to cost the American economy trillions, the entire world begins to reshuffle on the basis of identity.
2169:
-	The Americans begin the crackdown at home, Moralist genetic propaganda begins to be shown on billboards, promoting good health and a brighter future for your children. Opposition to radical transhumanism and the crackdown on “genetic freaks” is seen as widely popular in America. China is doing its own program, disallowing genetic augmentation in exchange for a system of purification. America might be restricting transhumanism, but China is purifying through old school eugenics.
-	Egalist protests erupt across the West Coast and New England, but is generally swamped out by the much larger mass of the country in support of these things.
-	Buchanan announces a form of “technocratic conservatism” as his main mandate for his second term. Essentially, he wanted to prune the government down to the bare basics. The government shouldn’t care about moral issues… That’s the Moralintern’s job, effectively outsourcing moral issues to the church. The government, the government will just be sitting here taking care of tax and regulation policy. But you want to talk social issues? Take it up with the church. While marketed as a pivot to small government, it really just transferred more power to the Moralintern, which was slowly becoming a parallel government made to regulate people’s genetic and personal lives.
-	Across the world, the Transhumanism Wars were being waged. 
o	The reason America had these crackdowns is because they let their people be relatively free in transhumanism for so long. 
o	In Latin America, few forced assimilations back to the human baseline occurred, as they simply never allowed much transhumanism in the first place. Much of it was under the social teachings of the Catholic Church, who was the moral authority on these matters. 
o	In Europe, you saw an exodus of transhumanist individuals from America, but this wasn’t a warm welcome. The Euronetwork expected them to obey, and conform for the good of their grand bureaucratic project. 
o	The European Brotherhood expected them to fight, to sacrifice themselves for honor. 
o	The Middle East saw them as abominations, casting them out into the desert. 
o	The South Indians received them, in a country running out of space to grow, where slums were piling up to the sky. 
o	In Southeast Asia, little ruled but the dollar, and these new workers were gladly exploited for the sake of shareholder values. 
o	And slowly but surely, all of the world’s desperate aberrant refugees began funnelling to Africa, whose social services and maintenance began straining the continent’s economy.
